"11/20/1997--Line item veto by President. (On June 25, 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that the Line Item Veto Act (Public Law 104-130) is unconstitutional, thus restoring provisions that had been cancelled as summarized below.) (On November 20, 1997, the President exercised his line item veto authority with respect to discretionary budget authority for: (1) Biocontrol and Insect Rearing Laboratory, Stoneville, Mississippi; (2) Poisonous Plant Laboratory, Logan, Utah; and (3) special research grants, projects \"Dairy, Alaska,\" \"Hydroponic Tomato Production, Ohio,\" and \"Plant Genome Research, Ohio.\") (Note: The high degree of specificity of the cancelled items precluded their inclusion in the original law's summary. As a result, the original law's summary and the summary of the law after the item veto are identical. For more information on the specific items vetoed, see the text of the conference report for H.R. 2160, H.Rept. 105-252, and Presidential Cancellation Numbers 97-77 through 97-81.)
