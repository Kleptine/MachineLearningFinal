Revises the apportionment of airport improvement fund amounts to sponsors of primary airports and reliever and nonprimary (but excluding primary) commercial service airports and to the States in any fiscal year in which the total amount made available for airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning projects is $3.2 billion or more (including cargo only airports in which the total amount for such projects is less than $3.2 billion). Authorizes the use of airport improvement funds apportioned to Alaska, Puerto Rico, or Hawaii for any of their public airports. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to permit the use of State highway specifications for airfield pavement construction using airport improvement funds at nonprimary airports with runways of a certain length and serving certain aircraft, provided safety will not be negatively affected and the life of the pavement will not be shorter than it would be if constructed using FAA standards. Prohibits such airports from seeking airport improvement funds for runway rehabilitation or reconstruction of any airfield pavement constructed using State highway specifications for a period of ten years after construction is completed unless the Secretary determines that the rehabilitation or reconstruction is required for safety reasons. Authorizes the use of State-apportioned airport improvement funds for integrated airport system planning that encompasses one or more primary airports.

Outlines loan conditions and limitations, including that: (1) the maximum amount guaranteed on a loan or extended on credit shall be no more than 50 percent, or $100 million; (2) such aircraft comply with certain Federal noise-level requirements; and (3) the air carrier agrees that the purchased aircraft be used to provide service to an underserved market. Authorizes the Secretary to make use of federal facilities and assistance in carrying out the incentive program. Authorizes appropriations through 2004. Terminates the Secretary's program authority five years after enactment of this Act.  \n    Subtitle\n    B\n     - \n    Airline Customer Service\n    Amends Federal aviation law to make it an unfair or deceptive practice for any air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent utilizing electronically transmitted tickets (E-tickets) for air transportation to fail to notify the purchaser of the termination of such ticket. \n    Section\n    222\n     - \n    \n    Increases the maximum civil penalty for violations of aviation consumer protection laws.  \n    Section\n    223\n     - \n    \n    Authorizes appropriations through FY 2003 for the enforcement of air travelers rights under airline consumer protection laws.  \n    Section\n    224\n     - \n    \n    Requires each air carrier that is a member of the Air Transport Association, and that has entered into the voluntary customer service commitments established by the Association on June 17, 1999, to provide a copy of its individual customer service plan to the Secretary.
