"7/25/2000--Introduced. Small Business Competition Preservation Act of 2000 - Directs the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to develop and maintain a database containing data and information regarding: (1) each bundled contract (two or more procurement contracts bundled together, the result of which is likely to make such contract unsuitable for small businesses due to the complexity or quantity required by the bundled contract) awarded by a Federal agency; and (2) each small business that has been displaced as a prime contractor as the result of the award of such a contract. Directs the Administrator, for each bundled contract, to determine: (1) the amount of savings and benefits achieved by bundling the contract requirements; and (2) whether such savings and benefits will continue if such contract remains bundled, and whether such savings and benefits would be greater if the procurement requirements were divided into separate solicitations suitable for award to small businesses. Requires an annual report from the Administrator to the congressional small business committees on contract bundling."
