"5/15/1991--Passed Senate amended. Declares that the Senate: (1) believes that the danger of public disorder in parts of the Soviet Union due to food shortages could lead to political repression and jeopardize \"glasnost\" and \"perestroika\"; and (2) urges the administration to complete expeditiously its review of the Soviet agricultural credit guarantee request. Urges the administration, when considering such request and the requests of other nations, to evaluate such countries' ability to service the debt associated with such requests. Reaffirms concerns about Soviet policies toward the Baltics and the Republics of the Soviet Union, including the refusal of the Soviet Government to engage in good faith negotiations with the Baltic States. Declares that such policies will affect the decision to extend such credit guarantees. Recommends that the administration approve the Soviet request provided the Soviet Union meets certain criteria beyond criteria under the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, as amended by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, including assurances that such credit guarantees will not be misused and other specified objectives will be met. Urges the Administration to admonish the Soviet Government strongly, in negotiations for any program of economic cooperation, that the only solution to its economic problems is a free market economy."
