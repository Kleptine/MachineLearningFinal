"10/6/1997--Line item veto by President. (On February 25, 1998, the President's cancellations (by line item veto) of provisions of H.R. 2016 were disapproved when H.R. 2631 became public law 105-159, thus reinstating such provisions.) (On October 6, 1997, the President exercised his line item veto authority to cancel $286.7 million in discretionary budget authority for 38 military construction items in this Act, including ten Air Force projects, nine Navy projects, nine Army projects, three Army National Guard projects, three Air Force reserve projects, two Naval Reserve projects, and two Army Reserve projects. The following revised digest summarizes the enacted version of H.R. 2016 as modified by line item veto.) (Note: The high degree of specificity of the items cancelled precluded their inclusion in the original law's summary. As a result, the original law's summary and the summary of the law after the item vetoes are identical. For more information on the specific items vetoed, see the text of the conference report for H.R. 2016, H. Rept. 105-247, and Presidential Cancellation Numbers 97-4 through 97-41.))
