Prescribes consultation and coordination guidelines. Permits the Board and the Secretary to authorize financial subsidiaries of banks to engage in merchant banking. Permits such financial activities upon the condition that all insured bank holding company (BHC) subsidiary depository institutions are well capitalized and well-managed, and upon BHC certification that they meet certain Board standards. Authorizes the appropriate Federal banking agency to prohibit an FHC or insured depository institution from commencing any new activity, or acquiring control of a company engaged in such activity, if any of its insured depository institution subsidiaries or affiliates failed to receive a satisfactory rating at its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA). Instructs the Board to apply capital and management standards that are comparable to a U.S. counterpart of a foreign bank that operates a branch or agency, or owns or controls a commercial lending company in the United States, giving due regard to the principle of national treatment and equality of competitive opportunity. Cites circumstances under which certain companies that become BHCs after enactment of this Act are authorized to continue their commodities transactions and affiliations. Sets forth cross-marketing restrictions for FHC-controlled depository institutions. Nullifies a BHC election to become an FHC if its subsidiary insured depository institutions failed to achieve a rating of \"satisfactory record of meeting community credit needs\" at its most recent examination.  \n    Section\n    104\n     - \n    \n    Retains the McCarran-Ferguson Act as the law of the United States. Proscribes any State laws which impede or restrict insurance sales activities by an insured depository institution. Enumerates permissible State restrictions upon certain insurance sales practices conducted by insured depository institutions. Preserves certain State regulatory oversight over insurance. Preempts certain State affiliation laws governing insurance companies and affiliates.
