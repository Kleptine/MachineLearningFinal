Provides that any State program or activity to protect the integrity of the electoral process by assuring an accurate and current voter registration roll for elections for Federal office shall: (1) be uniform and nondiscriminatory; and (2) not result in the removal of the name of any person from the official list of registered voters for failing to vote. Requires any program designed to systematically remove ineligible voters from the rolls to complete its work 90 days prior to a primary or general election for Federal office.
