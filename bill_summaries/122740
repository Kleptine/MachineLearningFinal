Provides alternatives for students at public schools failing to meet AYP standards within certain periods, including: (1) public school transfer options for all students at such schools; and (2) supplementary educational services for low-income children who remain at such schools, with such services allowed to be provided by various entities (which may be public or private, nonprofit or for-profit, and may include religious institution-based ones, provided all content and instruction under such services are secular, neutral, and nonideological). Reauthorizes and revises other requirements under the I-A-1 basic program for: (1) State and LEA plans; (2) eligible school attendance areas; (3) schoolwide programs; (4) targeted assistance schools; (5) State reservation of funds for school support, improvement, and recognition; (6) parental involvement; (7) participation of children enrolled in private schools, and (8) certain fiscal and coordination requirements.

Sets forth accountability requirements for State educational agencies (SEAs), local educational agencies (LEAs), and schools to ensure that their students meet such standards. Requires each State to define AYP in a specified manner, which includes separate measurable annual objectives for continuous and substantial improvement for the achievement of all public elementary school and secondary school students in the State, and for the achievement of specific groups: (1) economically disadvantaged students; (2) students from major racial and ethnic groups; (3) students with disabilities; and (4) students with limited English proficiency. Requires States, by the 2005-2006 school year, to conduct annual academic standards-based assessments in mathematics and reading or language arts in grades 3 through 8.

Establishes requirements for academic assessment and for LEA and school improvement. Requires LEAs receiving I-A funds to identify for school improvement any elementary school or secondary school served under I-A that fails, for two consecutive years, to make AYP as defined in the State's plan. Makes such requirement inapplicable to a school if almost every student in each of specified groups enrolled in such school is meeting or exceeding the State's proficient level of academic achievement. Allows LEAs, for schools that are conducting targeted assistance programs, to opt to review the progress of only the students in the school who are served, or are eligible for services, under I-A. Requires an LEA to provide all students enrolled in a school identified for improvement with the option to transfer to another public (including charter) school served by the LEA and not identified for improvement, unless such an option is prohibited by State law. (Requires, to the extent practicable, cooperative agreements with other LEAs in the area for such transfers if all the LEA's public schools are identified for school improvement, corrective action or restructuring.) Requires priority in providing such option to be given to the lowest achieving children from low-income families. Requires LEAs to pay for transportation for students who exercise such option. Requires LEAs to permit children who remain at the school to which they transferred until they have completed the highest grade in that school; but terminates an LEA's obligation to provide for transportation at the end of a school year, if the LEA determines that the former school is no longer identified for improvement or subject to corrective action or restructuring. Requires LEAs to use certain amounts for paying for such transportation (and for providing supplemental educational services for eligible low-income children at schools that fail to make AYP one year after being identified for improvement). Requires an LEA, before identifying a school for improvement (or for failure to make AYP after identification for corrective action, or for restructuring due to failure after corrective action), give the school an opportunity to review school-level data and present evidence. Requires each school identified for improvement, after such review is resolved, to develop or revise a two-year school plan in consultation with parents, school staff, the LEA, and outside experts. Requires such plans to include a mentoring program for teachers. Requires LEAs to provide specified types of technical assistance to schools identified for improvement. Requires an LEA, for any school served under I-A that fails to make AYP by the end of the first full school year after identification for improvement, to: (1) continue to provide technical assistance to the school and the public school transfer option to all the school's students; and (2) make tutoring and other supplemental educational services available to eligible low-income children. Allows such supplemental educational services to be provided by an LEA, nonprofit entity, or for-profit entity that: (1) has a demonstrated record of effectiveness in increasing student academic achievement; (2) can provide such services consistent with the LEA's instructional program and the academic standards described in the State's plan; and (3) is financially sound.

Requires LEAs to promptly notify parents of students in schools identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring. Requires LEAs to implement systems of corrective actions for schools identified for improvement. Requires LEAs, by the end of the second full school year after such identification, to: (1) continue to provide all students enrolled in the school with the option to transfer to another public school served by the LEA; (2) continue to provide specified types of technical assistance while instituting any corrective action; (3) continue to make supplemental educational services available to children who remain in the school; and (4) identify the school for corrective action. Requires the LEA, in the case of a school identified for corrective action, to do at least one of the following: (1) replace the school staff who are relevant to the failure to make AYP; (2) institute and fully implement a new curriculum, including providing appropriate professional development for all relevant staff, that is based on scientifically based research and offers substantial promise of improving educational achievement for low-achieving students and enabling the school to make AYP; (3) significantly decrease management authority at the school level; (4) appoint an outside expert to advise the school on its progress toward making AYP, based on its school plan; (5) extend the school's school year or school day; or (6) restructure the school's internal organizational structure. Allows the LEA to delay for not more than one year implementation of requirements relating to failure to make AYP after identification, corrective action, or restructuring, if: (1) a school makes AYP for one year; or (2) a school's failure to make AYP is due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the LEA or school. Requires LEAs to publish and disseminate information regarding any corrective action at a school to the public and to students' parents. Sets forth restructuring requirements for schools that continue to fail to make AYP after a full year of corrective action. Requires LEAS to: (1) continue to provide public school transfer options to all students enrolled there, as well as supplemental educational services for eligible children who remain in the school; and (2) plan and implement a major restructuring of the school's governance arrangement that makes fundamental reforms and has substantial promise of enabling the school to make AYP. Includes among such restructuring arrangements for a school: (1) reopening as a public charter school; (2) replacing all or most of the staff (which may include the principal) relevant to the AYP failure; (3) making a contract for operation of the public school by a public or private entity with a demonstrated record of effectiveness; or (4) SEA operation of the school. Directs the Secretary to provide technical assistance for such restructuring to certain small, rural LEAs that request it. Requires an LEA to promptly notify teachers and parents of students at a school to be restructured, and provide them adequate opportunity to comment on any such action and participate in developing any such plan. Prohibits an LEA from continuing to subject a school to requirements of school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring or to identify the school for school improvement for the succeeding school year, if the school makes AYP for two consecutive school years. Requires SEAs to provide: (1) technical assistance for school assessment and improvement; (2) annual review of LEA compliance with school assessment and improvement requirements; and (3) notice to the Secretary of schools or LEAs identified for improvement. Authorizes States to make certain rewards to LEAs that have exceeded AYP for two consecutive years.
