"4/25/2012--Passed Senate amended. 21st Century Postal Service Act of 2012 - \n    Title\n    I\n     - \n    Postal Workforce Matters\n    \n    Section\n    101\n     - \n    \n    Requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to determine, on an annual basis, the amount of any surplus contributions by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) and to transfer any such amount to USPS in FY2011-FY2014 to be used to pay the cost of voluntary separation incentive payments for postal employees who voluntarily separate from service before October 1, 2015. Allows any additional surplus contributions to be used for repayment of debts incurred by USPS or for making required payments to the Employees' Compensation Fund, USPS retiree health benefits funds, and the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.  \n    Section\n    102\n     - \n    \n    Allows USPS to: (1) provide voluntary separation incentive payments of up to $25,000 to USPS employees who voluntarily separate before October 1, 2015; and (2) offer up to one year of additional creditable service for postal employees in the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) who voluntarily separate from service before such date, and up to two years for employees in FERS who voluntarily separate from service before such date. Disqualifies any employee who receives such additional credits from receiving a voluntary separation incentive payment. Requires USPS to offer voluntary separation incentives to ensure that the size and cost of the USPS workforce is appropriate to perform its duties, taking into consideration the closure and consolidation of postal facilities, the ability of USPS employees to operate existing facilities more efficiently, and the number of employees eligible for retirement or early retirement. Establishes a goal for the reduction of USPS career employees of 18% by the end of FY2015.  \n    Section\n    103\n     - \n    \n    Restructures the pre-funding requirements for USPS retiree health benefits by replacing the current schedule of annual payments to the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund with a schedule of annual installment payments that will liquidate pension liabilities by September 30, 2052, or within 15 years, whichever is later. Requires the government's contributions to be paid first, beginning with enactment of this Act, from the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund up to the amount contained in the Fund (currently, such contributions are to be paid by the Postal Service through September 30, 2016). Reduces the pre-funding requirement for retiree health benefits to 80% of projected liability (currently, 100%).  \n    Section\n    104\n     - \n    \n    Authorizes USPS to negotiate jointly with all employee bargaining representatives until the end of FY2012 to establish the Postal Service Health Benefits Program outside of the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program.
