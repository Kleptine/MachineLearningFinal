Provides that, if the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (BCBP) or the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (BICE) finds indications of a pattern of conduct by an importer, exporter, or producer of false or unsupported representations that goods qualify under the rules of origin, the BCBP may suspend preferential tariff treatment under the Agreement for entries of identical goods covered by subsequent representations by the individuals until it determines that the representations conform with such rules.  \n    Section\n    207\n     - \n    \n    Authorizes the Customs Service to reliquidate an entry and refund any excess duties (including merchandise processing fees) paid on a good qualifying under the rules of origin for which no claim for preferential treatment was made at the time of importation if the importer takes certain actions within one year after such importation.  \n    Section\n    208\n     - \n    \n    Requires persons who issue a CAFTA-DR certification of origin for a good exported from the United States to make, keep for at least five years after such certification is issued, and render for examination and inspection all records and supporting documents related to such certification.  \n    Section\n    209\n     - \n    \n    Authorizes the President to direct the Secretary of the Treasury, during the period of a verification procedure by the government of a CAFTA-DR country, to determine: (1) that an exporter or producer in that country is complying with applicable customs laws, regulations, and procedures regarding trade in textile or apparel goods; or (2) that a claim is accurate that such a good exported or produced by the exporter or producer qualifies as an originating good, or is a good of a CAFTA-DR country. Requires the Secretary to: (1) suspend preferential tariff treatment under the Agreement of any textile or apparel good that a person subject to such verification has produced or exported if the Secretary believes there is sufficient information to sustain a claim for such treatment; (2) deny preferential treatment to such goods if the Secretary decides that a person has provided incorrect information to support a claim for such treatment; (3) detain such goods if the Secretary considers there is insufficient information to determine their country of origin; and (4) deny entry to such goods if the Secretary determines that a person has provided erroneous information of their origin. Authorizes: (1) the President to deny preferential treatment and entry into the United States to such textile and apparel goods, if the Secretary determines that the information obtained from verification is insufficient to make a determination; and (2) the Secretary to publish the name of any person engaged in intentional circumvention of applicable laws, regulations, or procedures affecting trade in such goods, or who has failed to demonstrate that it produces or is capable of producing them.  \n    Title\n    III\n     - \n    Relief From Imports\n    \n    Subtitle\n    A\n     - \n    Relief From Imports Benefiting From the Agreement\n    \n    Section\n    311\n     - \n    \n    Authorizes an entity (including a trade association, firm, certified or recognized union, or group of workers) to petition the ITC for an adjustment to U.S. obligations under the Agreement. Requires the ITC, upon the filing of a petition, to investigate promptly whether, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty provided for under the Agreement, a CAFTA-DR article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause or threat of serious injury to the domestic industry producing an article like, or directly competitive with, the imported article. Exempts from such an investigation any CAFTA-DR articles receiving import relief under the Agreement.  \n    Section\n    313\n     - \n    \n    Requires the President, after receiving an affirmative injury determination from the ITC, to provide certain four-year import relief to remedy or prevent such injury, and to facilitate efforts of the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition.

Requires the President, pursuant to such a request, to determine whether, as a result of the elimination of a duty under the Agreement, a CAFTA-DR textile or apparel article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to constitute a substantial cause or threat of serious damage to a domestic industry producing an article like, or directly competitive with, the imported article. Requires such determination within 30 days after the completion of any consultations held pursuant to the Agreement.  \n    Section\n    322\n     - \n    \n    Authorizes the President, if an affirmative serious damage determination is made, to provide certain import relief to remedy or prevent the damage and to facilitate adjustment by the domestic industry, including to increase the rate of duty imposed on the article to a level that does not exceed an amount determined according to a specified formula.  \n    Section\n    323\n     - \n    \n    Limits such relief to three years.  \n    Section\n    326\n     - \n    \n    Prohibits any import relief under this subtitle with respect to any article five years after the Agreement enters into force.  \n    Section\n    327\n     - \n    \n    Applies to any import relief provided by the President under this subtitle the compensation authority of the Trade Act of 1974, which authorizes the President to grant a CAFTA-DR country new concessions as compensation for the imposition of import relief in a textile and apparel safeguard proceeding, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal concessions under the Agreement.  \n    Section\n    328\n     - \n    \n    Prohibits the President from releasing confidential business information received in connection with a review under this subtitle unless the submitting party had notice, at the time of submission, that such information would be released, or the party subsequently consents to such release. Requires any party submitting such confidential business information also to provide a nonconfidential version of the information, in which the confidential business information is summarized or, if necessary, deleted.  \n    Subtitle\n    C\n     - \n    Cases Under Title II of the Trade Act of 1974\n    \n    Section\n    331\n     - \n    \n    Requires the ITC, whenever it makes an affirmative determination that an imported article constitutes a substantial cause or threat of serious injury to a domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with it, also to find (and report to the President) whether imports from CAFTA-DR countries that qualify as originating goods are a substantial cause or threat of serious injury to such industry. Authorizes the President to exclude goods of a CAFTA-DR country from any import relief action if they are not a substantial cause or threat of serious injury to the domestic industry.   \n    Title\n    IV\n     - \n    Miscellaneous\n    \n    Section\n    401\n     - \n    \n    Amends the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 to include among eligible products for U.S. government procurement a covered product or service of a foreign country or instrumentality that is a party to the Agreement.  \n    Section\n    402\n     - \n    \n    Amends the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) to define \"former beneficiary country\" as a country that ceases to be designated as a beneficiary country under the Act because the country has become a party to a free trade agreement with the United States. Removes the CAFTA-DR countries from CBERA's list of countries eligible for designation as beneficiary countries. Modifies CBERA's formula for determining rules of origin for duty-free treatment of eligible articles to include articles from former beneficiary countries. Defines \"former United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) beneficiary country\" as a country that ceases to be designated as a CBTPA beneficiary country under CBERA because the country has become a party to a free trade agreement with the United States. Makes articles from former CBTPA beneficiary countries eligible for preferential treatment if the article, or a good used in the production of the article, undergoes production in a CBTPA beneficiary country. Declares that such an article shall not be ineligible for preferential treatment because it is imported directly from a former CBTPA beneficiary country. Declares that an article that is a good of a former CBTPA beneficiary country for purposes of the Tariff Act of 1930 or the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, as the case may be, shall not be eligible for preferential treatment, unless: (1) it is a good of the Dominican Republic under this Act; and (2) the article, or a good used in its production, undergoes production in Haiti.  \n    Section\n    403\n     - \n    \n    Requires the President to report to Congress biennially, for 14 years, on the progress made by the CAFTA-DR countries in implementing: (1) Chapter Sixteen and Annex 16.5 of the Agreement; and (2) the April 2005 report of the Working Group of the Vice Ministers Responsible for Trade and Labor in the Countries of Central America and the Dominican Republic entitled \"The Labor Dimension in Central America and the Dominican Republic - Building on Progress: Strengthening Compliance and Enhancing Capacity\" (the White Paper).
