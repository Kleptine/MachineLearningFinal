"8/11/1997--Line item veto by President. (On June 25, 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that the Line Item Veto Act (Public Law 104-130) is unconstitutional, thus restoring provisions that had been cancelled as summarized below.) (On August 11, 1997, the President line-item-vetoed Sec. 4722(c), which deemed to be permissible broad-based health care related taxes certain taxes, fees, or assessments collected by New York State from a health care provider before June 1, 1997, for which a specified waiver has been applied, or would be but for this provision. The provision would thus exempt such taxes, fees, or assessments from the requirement that provider-specific taxes be subtracted from the State share of Medicaid expenditures for purposes of Federal share calculation. The following revised digest of H.R. 2015 reflects the Act as signed into law, minus the line-item-vetoed provision. For more information on the specific items vetoed, see the text of the conference report for H.R. 2015, H.Rept. 105-217, and Presidential Cancellation Number 97-3.)
