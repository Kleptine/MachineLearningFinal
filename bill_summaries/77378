"6/10/2003--Passed House amended. Unlawful Internet Gambling Funding Prohibition Act - Directs Federal functional regulators, within six months of this Act's enactment, to prescribe regulations requiring any designated payment system to establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to: (1) identify restricted transactions by means of code in authorization messages or other means and to block such transactions; and (2) prevent the acceptance of the products or services of the payment system in connection with a restricted transaction. Defines a \"restricted transaction\" as any transaction or transmittal to anyone engaged in the business of betting or wagering in connection with another person's participation in unlawful Internet gambling of credit, electronic fund transfers, checks, or the proceeds of any other form of financial transaction as regulators may prescribe. Requires such regulators and the Federal Trade Commission to enforce such regulations (under applicable law in the manner provided under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) after considering specified factors concerning the extent of the violation, the history of compliance, and the feasibility and burden of implementing a remedy. Requires regulators to consider exempting restricted transactions if the regulators find that it is not reasonably practical to identify and block, or otherwise prevent, such transactions. Provides that no provision of this Act shall be construed as affecting any law relating to, affecting, or regulating gambling within the United States."
