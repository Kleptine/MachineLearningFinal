"8/17/2006--Public Law. (This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on July 28, 2006. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Pension Protection Act of 2006 - \n    Title\n    I\n     - \n    Reform of Funding Rules for Single-Employer Defined Benefit Pension Plans: Subtitle A: Amendments to Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n    \n    Section\n    101\n     - \n    \n    Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to repeal existing funding rules for defined benefit pension plans for plan years beginning after 2007. Establishes new minimum funding standards for single-employer defined benefit pension plans, single-employer money purchase plans, and multiemployer plans. Requires employers to pay certain minimum required contributions. Allows the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) waive minimum funding standards in the event of a temporary substantial business hardship for single-employer plans or a substantial business hardship in the case of a multiemployer plan if application of the standard would be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate; (2) require a single-employer maintaining such a plan to provide security to such plan as a condition for granting or modifying a waiver. Limits the number of waivers that may be granted. Prohibits any amendment which increases the liability of a plan from being adopted if a waiver is in effect.  \n    Section\n    102\n     - \n    \n    Amends ERISA to set forth funding rules for single-employer defined benefit pension plans. Makes the minimum required contribution for single-employer plans the sum of the target normal cost of the plan for the plan year, the shortfall amortization charge, and the waiver amortization charge. Allows funding shortfalls to be amortized over seven years. Allows waiver charges to be amortized over five years. Sets forth rules governing the valuation of plan assets and liabilities. Allows a plan to determine the value of plan assets using fair market value if certain requirements are met. Requires a determination of present value to be based on actuarial assumptions and methods which: (1) are reasonable, taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations; and (2) offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan. Establishes a segmented interest rate for determining the present value of plan benefits. Bases the interest rate on the corporate bond yield curve for bonds which mature at three different times: in less than 5 years; between 5 and 20 years; and after 20 years. Defines \"corporate bond yield curve\" as a yield curve prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury which reflects the two-year average of monthly yields on investment grade corporate bonds with varying maturities and that are in the top three quality levels available. Sets forth transition rules for plans to implement the segmented interest rates. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe mortality tables to be used for determining any present value based on the actual experience of pension plans and projected trends in such experience. Requires such tables to be revised at least every 10 years to reflect the actual experience of pension plans and projected trends in such experience. Sets forth special rules for at-risk plans based on whether they are underfunded. Requires such plans to make different actuarial assumptions, which include assuming that participants will retire at the earliest possible date.  \n    Section\n    103\n     - \n    \n    Sets forth limitations on distributions and benefit accruals under single-employer plans. Prohibits the payment of benefits due to plant shutdowns and other unpredictable contingent events if the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan year: (1) is less than 60%; or (2) would be less than 60% taking into account such occurrence. Prohibits underfunded plans, with funding targets less than 80% as of their valuation dates, from: (1) adopting amendments that increase plan liabilities; and (2) providing lump sum distributions or other accelerated forms of benefits. Prohibits underfunded plans, with funding targets less than 60% as of their valuation dates, from all future benefit accruals. Sets forth exceptions to such prohibitions, as well as special timing rules, provisions for restoration of benefits, and notice requirements.  \n    Section\n    104\n     - \n    \n    Delays the effective date of the funding rules under this Act for eligible cooperative plans until: (1) the first plan year for which the plan ceases to be an eligible cooperative plan; or (2) January 1, 2017. Revises the interest rate used to determine the current liability and required contribution of an eligible cooperative plan sponsored by multiple employers to use the third segment rate, which is the rate of interest based on the corporate bond yield curve for such month taking into account only bonds maturing after 20 years. Makes such rate effective after 2007 and before new funding rules apply.  \n    Section\n    105\n     - \n    \n    Delays application of the funding rules for a PBGC settlement plan until January 1, 2014. Applies the third segment rate after 2007 and before 2014 to determine such a plan's current liability and required contribution.  \n    Section\n    106\n     - \n    \n    Delays application of the funding rules for an eligible government contractor cooperative plan until, at the latest, January 1, 2011. Applies the third segment rate after 2007 and before the funding rules become effective.  \n    Section\n    107\n     - \n    \n    Makes technical and conforming amendments.  \n    Subtitle\n    B\n     - \n    Amendments to Internal Revenue Code of 1986\n    \n    Section\n    111\n     - \n    \n    Amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to establish minimum funding standards for single-employer defined benefit pension plans.  \n    Section\n    112\n     - \n    \n    Sets forth funding rules for single-employer defined benefit pension plans.  \n    Section\n    113\n     - \n    \n    Sets forth limitations on distributions and benefit accruals under single-employer plans.  \n    Section\n    114\n     - \n    \n    Makes technical and conforming amendments.  \n    Section\n    115\n     - \n    \n    Sets forth a special funding rule for any underfunded plan sponsored by an employer engaged primarily in the interurban or interstate passenger bus service.  \n    Section\n    116\n     - \n    \n    Sets forth the treatment, including tax treatment, of deferred compensation to certain executives or highly compensated employees under nonqualified deferred compensation plans during any period when an employer's defined benefit plan is in, or within six months of, at-risk status or bankruptcy.   \n    Title\n    II\n     - \n    Funding Rules for Multiemployer Defined Benefit Plans and Related Provisions\n    \n    Subtitle\n    A\n     - \n    Amendments to Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n    \n    Section\n    201\n     - \n    \n    Amends ERISA to establish new funding rules for multiemployer defined benefit plans. Requires amounts attributable to unfunded past service liability, plan amendments, investment gains and losses, actuarial changes, and waived funding deficiency to be amortized over 15 years. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to extend the amortization period for up to 5 years upon a determination that: (1) without the extension, the plan would have an accumulated funding deficiency in any of the next 10 plan years; (2) the plan sponsor has adopted a plan to improve the plan's funded status; and (3) the plan is projected to have sufficient assets to pay expected benefit liabilities and other anticipated expenses in a timely manner. Authorizes the Secretary to grant an additional 5-year extension if not permitting it would result in substantial risk to voluntary continuation of the plan, or substantial curtailment of pension benefit levels or employee compensation, and be adverse to plan participants' aggregate interests.  \n    Section\n    202\n     - \n    \n    Establishes additional funding rules for multiemployer plans in endangered or critical status, including certification and notice requirements. Deems a plan to be in endangered status if it is not in critical status for the plan year and either: (1) its funded percentage for the plan year is less than 80%; or (2) it has an accumulated funding deficiency for the plan year or is projected to have such a deficiency for any of the six succeeding plan years, taking into account any extension of certain amortization periods. Deems plans to be in critical status if their funded percentage is less than 65% and certain other conditions are present, and in specified alternative circumstances. Requires for endangered plans (in various degrees of endangered status): (1) funding improvement plans; (2) sponsor actions, maintenance of contributions, and benefit restrictions pending such funding improvement plans' approval; (3) certain restrictions upon such approval; (4) default (critical status) if an improvement plan is not adopted; (5) standard funding improvement periods; (6) special rules for seriously underfunded plans; and (7) sponsor recommendation of alternative proposals to bargaining parties, and making relevant information available.

Allows plan sponsors discretion to treat a failure of a contributing employer to make required contributions under the rehabilitation plan as a withdrawal from the plan.  \n    Section\n    203\n     - \n    \n    Amends ERISA to require a sponsor of a plan in reorganization who determines that the plan will be insolvent in the next five years (by comparing the value of plan assets with the total amount of benefit payments made under the plan) to make such comparison at least annually until the sponsor determines that the plan will not be insolvent in any of the next five plan years.  \n    Section\n    204\n     - \n    \n    Revises the table used to determine an employer's withdrawal liability upon the employer's sale of assets.  \n    Section\n    205\n     - \n    \n    Prohibits a sponsor of a multiemployer plan or any other person from discriminating against any contributing employer for: (1) exercising rights under this Act; or (2) testifying before Congress in any proceeding relating to this Act.  \n    Section\n    206\n     - \n    \n    Exempts a multiemployer plan that is a party to an agreement approved by PBGC that increases benefits and provides for special withdrawal liability rules from the funding rules and withdrawal liability rules under this Act.  \n    Subtitle\n    B\n     - \n    Amendments to Internal Revenue Code of 1986\n    \n    Section\n    211\n     - \n    \n    Amends the IRC to establish funding rules for multiemployer defined benefit plans.  \n    Section\n    212\n     - \n    \n    Establishes additional funding rules for multiemployer plans in endangered or critical status.  \n    Section\n    213\n     - \n    \n    Amends the IRC to require a sponsor of a plan in reorganization who determines that the plan will be insolvent in the next five years to evaluate the plan at least annually until the sponsor determines that the plan will not be insolvent in any of the next five plan years.  \n    Section\n    214\n     - \n    \n    Prohibits a tax from being imposed for any accumulated funding deficiency of a multiemployer pension plan meeting certain requirements, including having contributing employers that participate in a federal fishery capacity reduction program and the Northeast Fisheries Assistance Program.  \n    Subtitle\n    C\n     - \n    Sunset of Additional Funding Rules\n    \n    Section\n    221\n     - \n    \n    Directs the Secretaries of Labor and the Treasury and the PBGC Executive Director to report to Congress on the effect of this Act on the operation and status of multiemployer plans.
