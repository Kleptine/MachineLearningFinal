"7/26/2002--Conference report filed in House. Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2002 - \n    Title\n    I\n     - \n    Needs-Based Bankruptcy\n    \n    Section\n    101\n     - \n    \n    Amends Federal bankruptcy law to revamp guidelines governing dismissal or conversion of a Chapter 7 liquidation (complete relief in bankruptcy), to one under either Chapter 11 (Reorganization), or Chapter 13 (Adjustment of Debts of an Individual with Regular Income).  \n    Section\n    101\n     - \n    \n    Permits the bankruptcy court to convert a Chapter 7 case to either Chapter 11 or 13 with a debtor's consent. (Currently requires the debtor's request for such a conversion.)  \n    Section\n    102\n     - \n    \n    Permits the court upon its own motion, or upon the motion of the bankruptcy trustee bankruptcy administrator, or any party in interest, to move for a dismissal. (Current law prohibits a party in interest from entering such motions). Lowers the \"substantial abuse\" standard for dismissal or conversion to one of simple abuse. Replaces the presumption in favor of granting the relief sought by the debtor with a presumption that abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly income exceeds an amount determined according to specified formulae. Includes within the calculation of debtor's monthly expenses: (1) reasonably necessary expenses incurred to maintain the safety of the debtor and the debtor's family from family violence as identified under the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act; (2) continuation of actual expenses paid by the debtor for the care and support of an elderly, chronically ill, or disabled household or non-dependent immediate family member; and (3) an additional allowance for housing and utilities based upon documented home energy expenses. Provides that the presumption of abuse may only be rebutted with detailed documentation of special circumstances requiring additional expenses or adjustment of currently monthly total income for which there is no reasonable alternative. Requires the debtor's counsel to reimburse the bankruptcy trustee for legal fees in prosecuting a dismissal or conversion motion if the court finds that counsel's filing under Chapter 7 was in violation of certain bankruptcy rules. Requires the court, upon motion by the victim of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime (or at the request of a party in interest), to dismiss a voluntary case filed by an individual debtor convicted of that crime (unless the debtor establishes that filing of the case is necessary to satisfy a claim for a domestic support obligation). Redefines \"disposable income\" of a chapter 13 debtor to exclude a domestic support obligation that first becomes payable after the date the petition is filed. Cites circumstances under which a chapter 13 wage earner's plan may be modified after confirmation to include a special allowance for health insurance coverage.  \n    Section\n    103\n     - \n    \n    Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury has the authority to alter Internal Revenue Service (IRS) standards established to set guidelines for repayment plans as needed to accommodate their use under the Bankruptcy Code. Instructs the Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Trustees to report to certain congressional committees regarding the use of Internal Revenue standards for determining specified monthly debtor expenses and the impact of such standards upon debtors and the bankruptcy courts.  \n    Section\n    104\n     - \n    \n    Revises procedural guidelines to mandate a written notice to the individual consumer debtor before commencement of a case stating: (1) the types of services available from credit counseling agencies; (2) the criminal penalties for fraudulent concealment of assets; and (3) that all creditor-supplied information is subject to examination by the Attorney General.  \n    Section\n    105\n     - \n    \n    Instructs the Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Trustees to: (1) develop a financial management training curriculum and materials to educate individual debtors on how to better manage their finances; and (2) test, evaluate, and report to Congress on the curriculum's effectiveness.  \n    Section\n    106\n     - \n    \n    Precludes an individual debtor from filing under Federal bankruptcy law unless the individual has received a briefing from an approved nonprofit budget and credit counseling service prior to filing a bankruptcy petition, unless the U.S. trustee or bankruptcy administrator determines that the service for the district in which the debtor lives is not reasonably able to provide adequate services to the additional individuals who would otherwise seek credit counseling because of such requirement. Conditions a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 discharge in bankruptcy upon the debtor's completion of an approved instructional course concerning personal financial management. Requires the clerk of each district to maintain a public list of credit counseling agencies and instructional courses concerning personal financial management. Prescribes criteria for approval of such agencies and courses. Prohibits such counseling service from informing a credit reporting agency whether an individual debtor has received or sought personal financial management instruction. Establishes civil penalties for noncompliance.  \n    Section\n    107\n     - \n    \n    Requires the Director of the Executive Office for United States Trustees to issue schedules of reasonable and necessary administrative expenses of administering a chapter 13 plan for each judicial district of the United States.  \n    Title\n    II\n     - \n    Enhanced Consumer Protection\n    \n    Subtitle\n    A\n     - \n    Penalties for Abusive Creditor Practices\n    \n    Section\n    201\n     - \n    \n    Cites circumstances under which the court may reduce a claim based upon unsecured consumer debts by up to 20 percent if the debtor can show by clear and convincing evidence that the claim was filed by a creditor who unreasonably refused to negotiate a reasonable alternative repayment schedule proposed by an approved credit counseling agency acting on the debtor's behalf.  \n    Section\n    202\n     - \n    \n    Makes a creditor's willful failure to credit payments received from a debtor (with a specified exception), if such failure caused material injury to the debtor, a violation of a discharge operating as an injunction against a collection action.  \n    Section\n    203\n     - \n    \n    Modifies debt reaffirmation guidelines governing wholly unsecured consumer debts to mandate specified detailed disclosures and explanations to the debtor for dischargeable debt agreements. Exempts a Credit Union creditor from such detailed disclosures and explanations. Amends Federal criminal law to instruct the Attorney General to designate U.S. attorneys and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to implement enforcement activities relating to: (1) abusive reaffirmations of debt; and (2) materially fraudulent statements in bankruptcy schedules that are intentionally false or misleading. Directs the bankruptcy court to establish procedures referring those cases to the U.S. attorneys and FBI agents.  \n    Section\n    204\n     - \n    \n    Preserves consumer claims and defenses against predatory loans that have been sold by the bankruptcy trustee, and that are subject to either the Truth in Lending Act or the Federal Trade Commission Preservation of Claims Trade Regulation.  \n    Section\n    205\n     - \n    \n    Instructs the General Accounting Office to study and report to Congress on the overall treatment of consumers within the context of the debt reaffirmation process, including recommendations for legislation to address abusive or coercive tactics.  \n    Subtitle\n    B\n     - \n    Priority Child Support\n    \n    Section\n    212\n     - \n    \n    Revises priority payment guidelines to place within the first priority claim category certain unsecured claims for domestic support obligations, if the funds received by a governmental unit are applied in a prescribed order. Grants priority over such claims, however, to specified administrative expenses of certain trustees.  \n    Section\n    213\n     - \n    \n    Conditions court confirmation of a debt repayment plan under Chapters 11, 12 (Debts of a Family Farmer), and 13 upon certification that debtor has payed in full all adjudicated domestic support obligations that become due after the petition filing date.  \n    Section\n    214\n     - \n    \n    Excepts from an automatic stay specified choses-in-action pertaining to domestic support obligations proceedings including: (1) child custody or visitation; (2) dissolution of marriage; (3) domestic violence; (4) withholding of income that is property of the bankrupt estate for payment of domestic support obligations; (5) suspension of drivers' licenses and professional licenses; (6) reporting of overdue support owed by a parent to certain consumer reporting agencies; (7) interception of specified tax refunds; (8) establishment of paternity; (9) establishment or modification of an order for domestic support obligations; and (10) enforcement of medical obligations under title IV, part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of the Social Security Act.  \n    Section\n    215\n     - \n    \n    Revamps guidelines governing the nondischargeability of certain debts for alimony, maintenance, and support to repeal the exceptions granted the debtor under specified conditions.  \n    Section\n    216\n     - \n    \n    Modifies guidelines governing property exempt from the bankruptcy estate to declare such property liable for a debt arising from domestic support obligations.  \n    Section\n    217\n     - \n    \n    Prohibits the bankruptcy trustee from avoiding a transfer that is a bona fide payment of a debt for a domestic support obligation.  \n    Section\n    218\n     - \n    \n    Excludes income payments for postpetition domestic support obligations from \"disposable income\" for purposes of a Chapter 12 confirmation plan.  \n    Section\n    219\n     - \n    \n    Sets forth the duties of the bankruptcy trustee to notify the claim holder and the appropriate State child support agency of the debtor's last known address.  \n    Section\n    220\n     - \n    \n    Declares dischargeable any debts for certain qualified educational loans which, if not discharged, would impose an undue hardship upon either the debtor or the debtor's dependent.  \n    Subtitle\n    C\n     - \n    Other Consumer Protections\n    \n    Section\n    221\n     - \n    \n    Modifies guidelines governing nonattorney bankruptcy petition preparers to mandate that as a prerequisite to any collection of fees for services: (1) such preparers officially disclose to debtors that they cannot practice law or give legal advice; and (2) such disclosure be signed by the debtor and filed with the requisite court documents.

Delineates conditions under which a history of previous petitions in bankruptcy gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the case is not filed in good faith.  \n    Section\n    303\n     - \n    \n    Directs the court to grant two-year relief from the automatic stay upon request of a party in interest in connection with certain real property actions if the court finds that filing the bankruptcy petition was part of a scheme to delay, hinder, and defraud creditors.  \n    Section\n    304\n     - \n    \n    Modifies debtor's duties to mandate specified affirmative actions incumbent upon a chapter 7 debtor, including reaffirmation of the debt, or redemption of the property within 45 days, in order to retain possession of personal property. Allows a creditor to take action with respect to such property under nonbankruptcy law if the debtor fails to act within 45 days, unless the court determines upon trustee motion that such property is of consequential value or benefit to the estate.  \n    Section\n    305\n     - \n    \n    Terminates the automatic stay governing property of the debtor's estate that secures a claim, or is subject to an unexpired lease, if the debtor fails to complete within a revised, accelerated time frame an intended surrender of consumer debt collateral, or an intended property redemption, or debt reaffirmation to retain such collateral (unless the court determines upon trustee motion that such property is of consequential value or benefit to the estate).  \n    Section\n    306\n     - \n    \n    Requires the bankruptcy court to confirm a Chapter 13 plan if it provides that the holder of a secured allowed claim shall retain the attendant lien until payment or discharge of all debts.

States that statutory guidelines to determine the secured status of a creditor's claim do not apply if: (1) the creditor has a purchase money security interest securing the debt; (2) the underlying debt was incurred within the 910 day period preceding the filing of the petition; and (3) the collateral for that debt consists of a motor vehicle acquired for the debtor's personal use (or if the collateral consists of any other thing of value if the debt was incurred during the one-year period preceding such filing).  \n    Section\n    307\n     - \n    \n    Increases from 180 days to 730 days the duration of debtor's domicile for purposes of determining which State law governs the debtor's selection of property exempt from the bankrupt estate. Provides for determination of an immediately earlier domicile if the debtor's domicile has not been located in a single State for the 730-day period. Allows a debtor to exempt certain property if the effect of the domiciliary requirement is to render the debtor otherwise ineligible for any exemption.  \n    Section\n    308\n     - \n    \n    Requires reduction of the value of the homestead exemption to the extent that it is attributable to any portion of property disposed of in the ten-year period before the petition filing date with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor.  \n    Section\n    309\n     - \n    \n    Revises requirements governing the effects of conversion from chapter 13 to another chapter. Declares that: (1) valuations of property and of allowed secured claims in a chapter 13 case shall not apply in a case converted to chapter 7; and (2) with respect to cases converted from Chapter 13, the claim of any creditor holding security as of the date of the petition shall continue to be secured by that security unless the full claim amount, as determined under applicable nonbankruptcy law, has been paid in full as of the conversion date. States that a prebankruptcy default shall have the effect given under applicable nonbankruptcy law unless it has been fully cured pursuant to the plan at the time of conversion. Provides for a Chapter 7 debtor's assumption of unexpired leases of personal property. Declares that in a Chapter 11 case in which the debtor is an individual, and in a Chapter 13 case, if the lease is not assumed in the plan, it is rejected (thus no longer subject to an automatic stay). Delineates a cash payment plan for chapter 13 debtors for payments to any lessor of personal property and to any creditor holding a claim secured by personal property in order to ensure adequate protection to the claim holder during the payment period. Requires a debtor-in-possession to provide reasonable evidence of any requisite insurance coverage with respect to the use or ownership of such property.  \n    Section\n    310\n     - \n    \n    Reduces from $1,075 to $500 the aggregate consumer debts owed to a single creditor on luxury goods, and incurred within 90 (currently 60) days before an order for relief, which are presumed nondischargeable in bankruptcy. Reduces cash advances that are extensions of consumer credit under an open end credit plan from $1,075 to $750, if acquired within 70 (currently 60) days.  \n    Section\n    311\n     - \n    \n    Denies an automatic stay of certain eviction proceedings by a lessor against a debtor involving residential real property if: (1) the lessor obtained judgment for possession prior to the bankruptcy filing date; or (2) lessor furnishes certification of specified debtor offenses.  \n    Section\n    312\n     - \n    \n    Extends the period between Chapter 7 discharges from six to eight years. Denies a chapter 13 discharge to any debtor who has received a discharge: (1) in a chapter 7, 11, or 12 case within the preceding four years; or (2) in another chapter 13 case within the preceding two years.  \n    Section\n    313\n     - \n    \n    Defines a debtor's household goods to include specified items.

Requires the court to order dismissal within five days of a request by a party in interest for debtor's failure to timely submit requisite documentation.
