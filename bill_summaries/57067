Establishes an end strength ceiling of 240 full-time Intelligence Community Staff employees, including 50 full-time personnel who are authorized to serve in the Security Evaluation Office.

Specifies that the five years of marriage spent outside the United States required to qualify for former spouse status must have been during periods of the participant's service with the CIA. Permits a retiree under CIARDS who was unmarried at the time of retirement to: (1) elect a reduction in an annuity for purposes of providing a survivor benefit upon marriage after retirement (currently, an election for a current spouse must be equal to the election made for a spouse to whom the participant was married at the time of retirement); and (2) irrevocably elect within one year of remarriage, where his or her annuity was not reduced to provide a survivor annuity at the time of retirement, to provide an annuity for the new spouse in the event such spouse survives the retired participant (in such case, the retired participant would be required to deposit an amount by which his or her annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date of retirement; or, if later, the date the previous reduction in the annuity was terminated). Reduces the remarriage age for purposes of entitlement to survivor and retirement benefits under CIARDS. Requires a surviving spouse who remarries a retiree and becomes entitled to a CIARDS survivor annuity to choose between such annuity and any other survivor annuity to which he or she may be entitled to be eligible to receive survivor annuity payments. Provides for the restoration of benefits of certain former CIA spouses whose benefits were terminated because of remarriage before the age of 55, and whose remarriage is later dissolved by death, annulment, or divorce.

Prohibits such activities from being conducted after December 31, 1995. Sets forth provisions concerning the use, disposition, and auditing of funds generated by such activities. Authorizes the Secretary, if compliance with any Federal laws and regulations would create an unacceptable risk of compromise of an authorized intelligence collection activity, to permit the operation of the activity notwithstanding such laws and regulations.
