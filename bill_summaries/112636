"6/11/1998--Introduced. Condemns and calls for the condemnation of the brutal killing of James Byrd, Jr., which occurred in Jasper, Texas, as unacceptable and outrageous. Declares that the House of Representatives pledges to: (1) do everything in its power to probe the underlying causes of this brutal killing; and (2) join in efforts to bring an end to racism and the underlying fear and hatred and to encourage all Americans to dedicate themselves to ending racism and violence in the United States. Calls on the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the White House, and all other Federal law enforcement agencies to conduct an immediate, full, and fair investigation into all of the facts of the case to aggressively respond to this tragedy with indictments. Urges the prosecution to proceed aggressively with a fair but speedy trial."
