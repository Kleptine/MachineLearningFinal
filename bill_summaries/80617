"2/27/2003--Passed House amended. Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2003 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit any person or entity, in or affecting interstate commerce, from knowingly: (1) performing or attempting to perform human cloning; (2) participating in such an attempt; (3) shipping or receiving an embryo produced by human cloning or any product derived from such embryo; or (4) importing such an embryo or derived product. Sets forth criminal and civil penalties. Provides that nothing in this Act restricts areas of scientific research not specifically prohibited above, including research in the use of nuclear transfer or other cloning techniques to produce molecules, DNA, cells other than human embryos, tissues, organs, plants, or animals other than humans. Directs the General Accounting Office to study and report to Congress on the need for amending such prohibition. Requires the study to include: (1) a discussion of related developments in medical technology, the need for somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce medical advances, current public attitudes and prevailing ethical views, and potential legal implications of research in somatic cell nuclear transfer; and (2) a review of any technological developments that may require that technical changes be made to such prohibition."
