"10/7/1990--Conference report filed in House. Sets forth the concurrent resolution on the budget for FY 1991 and the appropriate budgetary levels for FY 1992 through 1995. Sets forth: (1) maximum deficit amounts; (2) public debt increase amounts; (3) deficit levels excluding trust fund surpluses; and (4) recommended budgetary levels of Federal revenues, new budget authority, budget outlays, the public debt, and Federal credit activity, including funding for each major functional category. Requires specified Senate and House committees to report to their respective Committee on the Budget on changes in laws within their jurisdiction that provide spending authority sufficient to reduce budget authority and outlays by specified amounts. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Government should sell assets to nongovernment buyers; and (2) the amounts realized from such sales will not recur on an annual basis and do not reduce the demand for credit. Allows the Senate Committee on Finance to provide for increased funding for children, including funding through tax credits, if the funding legislation makes funds available and does not increase the deficit for FY 1991 through 1995."
