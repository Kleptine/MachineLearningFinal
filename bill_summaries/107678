States that Federal banking agencies for depository institutions should also share information with State insurance regulators on a confidential basis regarding transactions and relationships between depository institutions and affiliated companies engaged in insurance activities. Sets forth guidelines for such information exchange and confidentiality.  \n    Section\n    118\n     - \n    \n    Declares that BHCA restrictions placed upon Board authority over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries shall also limit the authority of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision with respect to such companies and their nonbank subsidiaries.  \n    Section\n    119\n     - \n    \n    Amends the FDIA to prohibit the use of the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) to benefit any affiliates or subsidiaries of certain insured depository institutions in receivership, in default, or in danger of default, or of any insured depository institution in such circumstances that is acquiring another insured depository institution.  \n    Subtitle\n    C\n     - \n    Subsidiaries of National Banks\n    Amends Federal law governing national banks to prohibit a subsidiary of a national bank from engaging in any activity, or owning any shares of a company engaged in any activity, that a national bank is not permitted to engage in directly, or that is conducted under terms or conditions other than those that would govern the conduct of the activity by a national bank.

Chapter 2: Wholesale Financial Institutions - Amends the Revised Statutes to permit a national bank to operate as a noninsured national WFI subject to FRA and the regulatory authority of the Comptroller of the Currency. Amends FRA to prescribe procedural guidelines for State bank membership as a noninsured WFI in the Federal Reserve System, subject to FDIA enforcement authority and prompt corrective action requirements.
