Allows a bankruptcy panel trustee and any party in interest to move for such dismissal or conversion (current law prohibits such party in interest from such motions). Lowers the \"substantial abuse\" standard for dismissal or conversion to one of simple abuse. Replaces the presumption in favor of granting the relief sought by the debtor with a presumption that abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly income exceeds specified formulae. Provides that the presumption of abuse may be rebutted only with detailed documentation of extraordinary circumstances requiring additional expenses or adjustment of currently monthly total income. (Sec. 102) Requires debtor's counsel to\n     - \n    (1) reimburse the bankruptcy trustee for legal fees in prosecuting a dismissal or conversion motion if the court finds that counsel's filing under chapter 7 was not substantially justified; and (2) pay a civil penalty for the violation of certain bankruptcy rules.
