"6/16/2006--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Honors: (1) all Americans who have taken an active part in the Global War on Terror, whether as first responders protecting the homeland, as servicemembers overseas, as diplomats and intelligence officers, or in other roles; and (2) the sacrifices of the U.S. Armed Forces and the Coalition partners, the Iraqis and Afghans who fight alongside them, their families, and others who risk their lives to help defend freedom. Declares that: (1) it is not in the U.S. national interest to set an arbitrary withdrawal or redeployment date for U.S. Armed Forces from Iraq; and (2) the United States is committed to completion of the mission to create a sovereign, free, and united Iraq. Congratulates Prime Minister Nuri Al-Maliki and the Iraqi people on the courage they have shown by participating, in increasing millions, in the 2005 elections and on the formation of the first government under Iraq's new constitution. Calls upon the nations of the world to promote global peace and security by standing with the United States and other Coalition partners to support the efforts of the Iraqi and Afghan people to live in freedom. Declares that the United States will prevail in the Global War on Terror."
