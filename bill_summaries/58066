Adds as conditions for approval of State plans (to be eligible for commercial motor vehicle safety enforcement grants) that such plans: (1) ensure that activities funded under such Act not diminish the effectiveness of development and implementation of commercial motor vehicle safety programs, that fines imposed and collected by the State for violations of commercial motor vehicle safety regulations will be reasonable and appropriate (and provide that the State will seek to implement the recommended fine schedule published by the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance), and that such State agency will coordinate the plan with the State highway safety plan; (2) ensure participation by the 48 contiguous States in SAFETYNET by January 1, 1994; and (3) give satisfactory assurances that the State will undertake efforts that will emphasize and improve enforcement of State and local traffic safety laws and regulations pertaining to commercial motor vehicle safety; will promote activities to remove impaired commercial motor vehicle drivers from the nation's highways, provide appropriate training to its motor carrier safety assistance program officers and employees on the recognition of drivers impaired by alcohol or controlled substances, promote enforcement of requirements relating to commercial motor vehicle driver licensing, and improve hazardous materials transportation regulations enforcement; and will promote effective interdiction and training activities affecting the transportation of controlled substances by commercial motor vehicle safety and hazardous materials transportation safety. Requires State plans to provide for maintenance of the level of expenditures for enforcement of commercial motor vehicle size and weight limitations, drug interdiction, and State traffic safety laws and regulations as conditions for approval of such plans at a level which does not fall below the average level of such expenditure for its last three (currently, two) full fiscal years preceding January 6, 1983. Authorizes the Secretary, in estimating such average level, to allow the State to exclude State expenditures for federally sponsored demonstration or pilot programs. Directs the Secretary to require the State to exclude Federal funds and State matching funds used to receive Federal funding under this title. Authorizes a State, subject to specified limitations, to use grant funds for: (1) enforcement of commercial motor vehicle size and weight limitations at locations other than fixed weight facilities, at specified geographical locations (such as steep grades or mountainous terrains), or at seaports where intermodal shipping containers enter and exit the United States; (2) detecting the unlawful presence of controlled substances in a commercial motor vehicle or on the person of any occupant of such vehicle; and (3) enforcement of State traffic laws and regulations designed to promote safe operation of commercial motor vehicles. Directs the Secretary to include in-kind contributions by the State in determining costs incurred by the State in the development and implementation of programs to enforce commercial motor vehicle rules, regulations, standards, or orders.

Repeals, effective January 1, 1994, a program which allowed States to require interstate motor carriers to register their interstate operating authority with the State and charge a fee for doing so. Replaces it with a new annual fee system enabling such States to continue to collect funds from such carriers, based upon the carrier's filing of proof of required liability insurance, under a streamlined system in which a carrier will pay its annual fees to a single State (its base State) and that State will distribute the collections to other participating States in which the carrier's vehicles operate. Sets forth additional limitations. Bars States from allowing on the IS and those classes of qualifying Federal-aid primary system highways as designated by the Secretary any commercial motor vehicle combination (except for those vehicles and loads which cannot be easily dismantled or divided and which have been issued special permits in accordance with applicable State laws) with two or more cargo carrying units (excluding the truck tractor) whose cargo carrying units exceed: (1) the maximum combination of trailer, semitrailer, or other types of length limitation authorized by statute or regulation of that State on or before June 1, 1991; or (2) the length of the cargo carrying units of those commercial motor combinations, by specific configuration, in actual, lawful operation on a regular or periodic basis (including continuing seasonal operation) in that State on or before such date.
