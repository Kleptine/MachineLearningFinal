"10/1/1998--Passed Senate amended. King Cove Health and Safety Act of 1998 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, if the King Cove Corporation offers to transfer specified lands to the United States, to accept the transfer of the offered lands and grant the Aleutians East Borough a perpetual right-of-way of 60 feet in width through specified lands in Seward Meridian, Alaska, for the construction, operation, and maintenance of certain utility-related fixtures and of a public road between the cities of Cold Bay and King Cove, Alaska. Requires the lands transferred to the United States to be managed in accordance with the Alaska National Lands Conservation Act. Directs the Secretary and the Borough to jointly prepare a plan setting forth: (1) the times of the year a road may reasonably be constructed when there are not high concentrations of migratory birds in Kinzarof Lagoon; and (2) limitations on nonemergency road traffic during periods of the year when there are high concentrations of migratory birds in that Lagoon. Provides that, if the Secretary and the Borough fail to mutually agree within 24 months of the offer on a final land exchange and grant of right-of-way, and on the right-of-way specifications and terms and conditions of use set forth in this Act, the Borough shall have the right to select a 60 foot right-of-way for the construction, operation, and maintenance of certain utility-related fixtures and of a public road from specified lands, and to identify logistical staging areas and construction material sites within the right-of-way. Grants the right-of-way to the Borough if an agreement is not reached within six months after the Borough notifies the Secretary of its selection."
