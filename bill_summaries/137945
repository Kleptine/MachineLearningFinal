Requires the Secretary to recommend additional disclosure requirements to the relevant regulators if disclosure pursuant to this market transparency requirement is not adequate for that purpose.  \n    Section\n    115\n     - \n    \n    Limits the Secretary's authority to purchase troubled assets under this Act to: (1) $250 billion outstanding at any one time; (2) $350 billion outstanding at any one time if, at any time, the President certifies to Congress that the Secretary needs to exercise authority for up to such an amount; and (3) $700 billion outstanding at any one time if, at any time after such a certification, the President reports to Congress a plan of the Secretary to exercise the authority authority for up to such an amount, unless Congress enacts a joint resolution of disapproval within 15 calendar days of transmission of the plan.
