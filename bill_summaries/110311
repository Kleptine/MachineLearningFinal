"6/3/1998--Introduced. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should reconsider his decision to be formally received in Tiananmen Square until the Government of the People's Republic of China acknowledges the Tiananmen Square massacre, pledges that such atrocities will never happen again, and releases those Chinese students still imprisoned for supporting freedom and democracy that day."
