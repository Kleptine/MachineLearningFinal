"9/24/1999--Passed House amended. Amends the Antiquities Act of 1906 to require the President, before declaring a national monument, to: (1) solicit public participation and comment in the designation's development; (2) consult with the Governor and congressional delegation of the State or territory in which the lands in question are located, to the extent practicable, at least 60 days before such a designation; and (3) consider any information made available in the development of existing plans and programs for the management of such lands, including public comments. Requires management plans for a national monument developed subsequent to a declaration to comply with the procedural requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Declares that nothing in this Act or any amendment made by it shall be construed to enlarge, diminish, or modify the authority of the President to act to protect public lands and resources."
