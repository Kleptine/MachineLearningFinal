"5/4/2000--Passed House amended. Alternative Water Sources Act of 2000 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to make grants for alternative water source projects to meet critical water supply needs to State, interstate, and intrastate water resource development agencies, local government agencies, private utilities, and nonprofit entities that have authority under State law to develop or provide water for municipal, industrial, or agricultural uses in areas experiencing critical water supply needs. Makes projects that have received funds under the reclamation and reuse program under the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 ineligible for grant assistance under this Act. Directs the Administrator, in making such grants, to consider whether a project is located within the boundaries of a State or area referred to in the Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902, and within the geographic scope of such reclamation and reuse program. Requires, for projects for which the Federal share of costs exceeds $3 million, approval by a resolution of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure or the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Requires the Administrator to report to Congress on progress made toward meeting the critical water supply needs of grant recipients. Authorizes appropriations. Expresses the sense of Congress, in the case of equipment or products authorized to be purchased with financial assistance provided under this Act, that entities receiving such assistance should, in expending such assistance, purchase only American-made equipment and products. Requires such entities to report any expenditures on foreign-made items to Congress."
