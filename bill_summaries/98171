Authorizes the President to fulfill his commitment to deploy such forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina for approximately one year to implement the General Framework Agreement (Agreement) and Military Annex, subject to specified conditions. Requires the President, before acting pursuant to this Act, to make available to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate, his determination that: (1) the mission of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Implementation Force (NATO force) and U.S. forces deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina will be limited to implementation of the military provisions of the Military Annex to the Agreement and measures deemed necessary to protect the safety of the NATO force and U.S. forces; (2) an integral part of the successful accomplishment of the U.S. objective in Bosnia and Herzegovina in deploying and withdrawing U.S. forces is the establishment of a military balance which enables the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to provide for its own defense without depending on United States or other outside forces; and (3) the United States will lead an international effort to provide equipment, arms, training, and logistics assistance of the highest quality to ensure that the Federation can provide for its own defense. Directs the President to submit reports to the Congress on: (1) efforts to enable the Federation to provide for its own defense; and (2) military and non-military aspects of implementation of the Agreement."
