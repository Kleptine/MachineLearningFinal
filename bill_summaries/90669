Hate Crime Statistics Act - Directs the Attorney General to: (1) acquire data, for 1990 through 1994, about crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, including murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, assault, arson, and vandalism; and (2) establish guidelines for the collection of such data, including the necessary evidence and criteria for a finding of manifest prejudice. States that nothing in this Act creates a right for an individual to bring an action based on discrimination due to sexual orientation. Prohibits the use of funds appropriated under this Act to promote or encourage homosexuality."
