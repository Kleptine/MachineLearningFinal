Allows a prescription drug plan (PDP) sponsor or Medicare+Choice organization, in the case of an individual who does not maintain such continuous prescription drug coverage, to increase the otherwise applicable premium, or to impose a pre-existing condition exclusion, with respect to qualified prescription drug coverage in a manner that reflects additional actuarial risk involved.

Directs the Medicare Benefits Administrator to establish by regulation other standards for PDP sponsors and plans.
