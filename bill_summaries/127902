Arts, Humanities, and Museums Amendments of 1993 - Amends the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965 to extend through FY 1995 the authorization of appropriations to carry out such Act, including funds for: (1) program grants and other assistance by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH); (2) matching non-Federal funds received; and (3) administration of NEA and NEH programs. Sets limitations on total appropriations authorized for the NEA and the NEH in FY 1994. Limits a State's current NEA allotment to not more than the preceding year's level if: (1) the State's current year funding for the arts is less than the average annual amount expended by the State during the most recent preceding period of three fiscal years; and (2) the rate of reduction in its arts spending exceeds that for the aggregate of the State's general fund reductions for the current fiscal year. Amends the Museum Services Act to extend through FY 1995 the authorization of appropriations, including funds for: (1) grants to museums to increase and improve services; and (2) functions of the Institute of Museum Services (which is within the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities)."
