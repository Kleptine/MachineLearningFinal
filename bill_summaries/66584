"3/4/2003--Passed Senate amended. Declares that the Senate strongly disapproves of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Newdow v. U.S. Congress and the decision of the full court not to reconsider the case en banc. Authorizes and instructs the Senate Legal Counsel either to seek to intervene in the case to defend the constitutionality of the words \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance, or to file an amicus curiae brief in support of such constitutionality."
