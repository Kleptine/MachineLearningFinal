"3/20/2002--Passed House without amendment. Freedom to Telecommute Act of 2002 - Requires the Federal Acquisition Regulation issued pursuant to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to be amended to permit the use of telecommuting by employees of Federal contractors in performing contracts with executive agencies. Requires such amendment to provide that solicitations shall not set forth any requirement or evaluation criteria that would render an offeror ineligible to receive a contract award or reduce the scoring of an offeror's proposal based upon the contractor's plan to allow its employees to telecommute, unless the contracting officer first determines and explains that the needs of the agency, including the agency's security needs, cannot be met without such requirement. Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress on agency compliance with the regulations and conformance of the regulations with existing law."
