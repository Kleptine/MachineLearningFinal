(Sec. 6A) Exempts the State of Texas, or its political subdivisions, from the Internet tax moratorium with respect to the imposition or collection of the Texas municipal access line fee.  \n    Section\n    7\n     - \n    \n    Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to specified congressional committees on the impact of the Internet tax moratorium on State and local government revenues and on the deployment and adoption of broadband technologies for Internet access throughout the United States."
