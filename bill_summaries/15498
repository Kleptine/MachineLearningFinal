Authorizes the U.S. Attorney (or in the case of certain felony offenses, the Attorney General), upon declining prosecution of the charged person as a juvenile, to refer the matter to the appropriate legal authorities of the State or Indian tribe with jurisdiction over both the offense and the juvenile. Directs the U.S. Attorney in the appropriate jurisdiction (or in the case of certain felony offenses, the Attorney General), in cases of concurrent jurisdiction between the Federal Government and a State or Indian tribe over both the offense and the juvenile, to exercise a presumption in favor of referral unless the U.S. Attorney (or Attorney General) certifies that: (1) the prosecuting authority or the juvenile court or other appropriate court of the State or Indian tribe refuses, declines, or will refuse or decline to assume jurisdiction over the conduct or the juvenile; and (2) there is a substantial Federal interest in the case or the offense to warrant the exercise of Federal jurisdiction. Authorizes a juvenile to be prosecuted and convicted as an adult for an offense that is properly joined under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure with a Federal offense that is a serious violent felony or serious drug offense, or that is a conspiracy or attempt to commit such offense. Permits conviction of a lesser included offense. Makes a determination to approve or not to approve, or to institute or not to institute, such a prosecution unreviewable. Directs the court in which criminal charges have been filed in such prosecution, if the juvenile was less than age 16 at the time of the offense, or in the case of certain felonies, upon motion of the defendant and after a hearing, to determine whether to issue an order to provide for the transfer of the defendant to juvenile status for purposes of proceeding against the defendant. Bars a motion by a defendant from being considered unless it is filed within 30 days after the date on which the defendant appears through counsel to answer an indictment or expressly waives the right to counsel and elects to proceed pro se. Prohibits the court from ordering the transfer of a defendant to juvenile status unless the defendant establishes by clear and convincing evidence or information that removal to juvenile status would be in the interest of justice.

Grants the U.S. Attorney (or, as appropriate, the Attorney General), in making determinations concerning juvenile arrest or prosecution, complete access to prior Federal and State (if permitted by State law) juvenile records. Specifies that certification regarding the trial of a juvenile as an adult shall not be made nor granted with respect to a juvenile who is subject to the criminal jurisdiction of an Indian tribal government if the juvenile is under age 15 at the time of the offense and is alleged to have committed an offense for which there would be Federal jurisdiction solely based on commission of the offense in Indian country, unless the governing body of the tribe having jurisdiction over the place where the alleged offense was committed has, before the occurrence of the alleged offense, notified the Attorney General in writing of its election that prosecution as an adult take place. Requires the court, in the case of a defendant convicted for conduct that occurred before the juvenile attained age 16, to impose a sentence without regard to any statutory minimum sentence upon finding at sentencing, after affording the Government an opportunity to make a recommendation, that the juvenile has not been previously adjudicated delinquent for, or convicted of, a serious violent felony or a serious drug offense. Directs the United States Sentencing Commission (the Commission) to: (1) amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to require that prior juvenile convictions and adjudications for crimes of violence, controlled substance offenses, any other offense for which the defendant received a sentence or disposition of imprisonment for one year or more, and any other offense punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year for which the defendant was prosecuted as an adult, receive a criminal history score for any juvenile offender being sentenced as an adult similar to that which the defendant would have received if those offenses had been committed by the defendant as an adult, if any portion of the sentence had been imposed or served within 15 years; (2) determine whether the criminal history treatment of juvenile adjudications or convictions for other offenses should be similarly adjusted and make any additional guideline amendments necessary; (3) assign criminal history points for juvenile adjudication based principally on the nature of the acts committed (and authorizes adjusting the score in light of the length of sentence the juvenile received); (4) submit emergency guidelines or amendments to Congress; and (5) amend the guidelines to provide for inclusion in any determination regarding whether a juvenile or adult defendant is a career offender, and in any computation of the sentence that any defendant found to be a career offender should receive, of any act for which the defendant was previously convicted or adjudicated delinquent as a juvenile that would be a felony if committed by the defendant as an adult.  \n    Section\n    104\n     - \n    \n    Modifies code provisions regarding custody prior to appearance before a magistrate to direct that: (1) the arresting officer notify the U.S. Attorney of the appropriate jurisdiction as soon as practicable and promptly take reasonable steps to notify the juvenile's parents, guardian, or custodian of custody; and (2) the juvenile not be subject to detention under conditions that permit prohibited physical contact or sustained oral communication with adult inmates.  \n    Section\n    105\n     - \n    \n    Provides for pretrial detention of juveniles tried as adults on the same basis as adults.

Directs the court to enter an order of restitution. Requires that any such imprisonment be terminated on the juvenile's 26th birthday and prohibits a juvenile sentenced to a term of imprisonment from being released from custody simply because the juvenile reaches age 18.  \n    Section\n    108\n     - \n    \n    Rewrites code provisions regarding the use of juvenile records to permit disclosure to unauthorized persons of the records of a juvenile proceeding and release of such records only to the extent necessary for specified purposes, including (subject to specified requirements): (1) docketing and processing by the court; (2) responding to inquiries from courts, law enforcement agencies, the director of certain treatment agencies or facilities, and victims and their immediate family; and (3) communicating with a victim or the victim's official representative.

Specifies that the parent, guardian, or custodian of a juvenile sentenced to pay a fine or ordered to pay restitution or a special assessment may not be made liable for such payment by any court.
