Revises minimum coverage requirements to allow a plan that otherwise fails to meet such requirements to constitute a qualified plan if it meets certain requirements that were in effect immediately before enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. (Such requirements stated that the plan must at least benefit employees qualifying under a classification set up by the employer and found by the Secretary not to be discriminatory in favor of employees who are officers, shareholders, or highly compensated.) Directs the Secretary to modify certain existing regulations with respect to employers operating separate lines of business to expand the ability of a pension plan to demonstrate compliance with the line of business requirements based upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the design and operation of the plan, even though the plan is unable to satisfy the mechanical tests currently used to determine compliance.  \n    Section\n    271\n     - \n    \n    Amends the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 to extend to international organizations the moratorium on application of certain nondiscrimination rules applicable to State and local governmental plans.  \n    Section\n    272\n     - \n    \n    Increases from 90 to 180 days certain notice and consent periods regardig distributions.

Provides for cost-of-living adjustments to the State ceiling. \n    Section\n    502\n     - \n    \n    Revises the housing priority selection criteria a housing credit agency must use to develop a qualified plan for allocating housing credit dollar amounts among projects.

Sets an alternative date for valuation of the taxpayer's actual basis in the project of which the building is a part (where the actual basis is more than ten percent of the taxpayer's reasonably expected basis). Allows the valuation of the actual basis to be as of the later of the date which is six months after the date that the allocation was made or (as currently) the close of the calendar year in which the allocation is made. Revises the formula for determination of the amount of State housing credit ceiling returned in a calendar year to include the dollar amount previously allocated to a project which fails to meet the ten percent test on a date after the close of the calendar year in which the allocation was made. Revises special rules for the increased basis of a building located in certain high cost areas to redefine a qualified census tract to include, as an alternative to existing criteria, a tract with a poverty rate of at least 25 percent.  \n    Section\n    506\n     - \n    \n    Revises the formula for determining unused housing credit carryovers allocated among certain States.  \n    Subtitle\n    B\n     - \n    Private Activity Bond Volume Cap\n    Provides for an accelerated phase-in of specified increases in the volume cap on private activity bonds.  \n    Subtitle\n    C\n     - \n    Exclusion From Gross Income for Certain Forgiven Mortgage Obligations\n    Excludes from gross income the discharge of qualified residential indebtedness. Limits such exclusion to the excess (if any) of the outstanding principal amount of such indebtedness (immediately before discharge) over the sum of any sales proceeds and any other outstanding principal indebtedness secured by such property.  \n    Title\n    VI\n     - \n    Amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938\n    Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase the Federal minimum wage (currently, $5.15 per hour) to: (1) $5.65 an hour during the year beginning on April 1, 2000; and (2) $6.15 an hour during the year beginning on April 1, 2001. \n    Section\n    603\n     - \n    \n    Exempts from minimum wage and overtime requirements: (1) certain network or database analysts, designers, and developers, including any whose primary duty is the management or training of employees performing specified duties related to computer systems or software design, or development; (2) certain sales employees with specialized or technical product or service knowledge and a detailed understanding of customer needs, who earn at least one-and-a-half times the minimum wage, plus commissions, and meet other specified requirements; and (3) licensed funeral directors and embalmers."
