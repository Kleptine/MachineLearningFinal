Title III\n     - \n    Physicians' Service Payment Reform\n    \n    Section\n    301\n     - \n    \n    Amends SSA title XVIII (Medicare) to require establishment of: (1) separate target growth rates for service categories; (2) separate conversion factors for each service category; and (3) updates for such conversion factors.  \n    Section\n    302\n     - \n    \n    Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish an expert panel to identify misvalued physicians' services; and (2) conduct a five-year review of physicians' services in conjunction with the five-year review by the American Medical Association/Specialty Society Relative Value Update Committee (RUC), particularly for services that have experienced substantial changes in length of stay, site of service, volume, practice expense, or other factors that may indicate changes in physician work. Gives the Secretary the authority to reduce the work component for services with accelerated growth without using the RUC process.  \n    Section\n    303\n     - \n    \n    Requires the Secretary to develop a mechanism to measure resource use on a per capita and an episode basis in order to provide confidential feedback to physicians in the Medicare program on how their practice patterns compare to physicians generally, both in the same locality as well as nationally.  \n    Section\n    304\n     - \n    \n    Creates incentive payments under the Medicare program for participating physicians practicing in an efficient area.  \n    Section\n    305\n     - \n    \n    Directs the Comptroller General to analyze and report to Congress on: (1) codes paid under the Medicare physician fee schedule to determine whether the codes for procedures that are commonly furnished together should be combined; and (2) those procedures under the same schedule for which no global payment methodology is applied but for which a \"bundled\" payment methodology would be appropriate.  \n    Section\n    306\n     - \n    \n    Directs the Secretary to establish: (1) an expanded medical home demonstration project; and (2) a process for selection of a qualified standard setting and certification organization to establish standards for medical practices to qualify as medical homes or as HIT-enhanced medical homes.

Requires phase-out of payments to MA plans in excess of 100% of the average Fee-for-Service (FFS) costs in each county over four years to 100% of the FFS cost in the county in 2011. Prescribes a formula for blended county benchmarks and FFS to accomplish this goal. Excludes indirect medical education (IME) costs from the calculation of the 100% FFS for an MA plan in a county area. Provides that, if a MA plan bid exceeds 106% of the county FFS amount for 2009 or 103% of the FFS amount in 2010, then that MA plan may not enroll any new enrollees for that year during the annual, coordinated election period or during the year (if the enrollment becomes effective during the year).

States that nothing shall be construed as prohibiting Medicare part C plans from using flat co-payments or per diem rates in lieu of part A or part B cost-sharing amounts, as long as they do not exceed the level of cost-sharing under traditional Medicare. Prohibits Medicare part C plans from imposing cost-sharing for dual-eligible individuals or qualified Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a Medicare part C plan that exceeds the cost-sharing amounts permitted under the Medicare and Medicaid statutes.  \n    Section\n    413\n     - \n    \n    Authorizes continuous open enrollment in Medicare part C plans for full benefit dual-eligible individuals and qualified Medicare beneficiaries (QMBs). Changes the continuous open enrollment period to allow institutionalized, dual-eligible individuals and QMBs to disenroll from MA plans and return to traditional Medicare at any time. Authorizes special election periods for specified low-income Medicare beneficiaries and beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare part C plans in which enrollment has been suspended for not meeting the terms of their contracts.

Increases from one year to two years the length of time certain categories of individuals who leave Medicare part C plans have to enroll in a Medigap plan. Prohibits the Secretary from enrolling Medicaid-eligible individuals (automatically) as dual-eligibles or QMBs in a Medicare part C plan without the individual's affirmative enrollment application.  \n    Section\n    414\n     - \n    \n    Directs the Secretary to publish for each Medicare part C plan: (1) its medical loss ratio in the previous year: (2) the per enrollee payment to the plan, as adjusted to reflect a risk score of 1.0; and (3) the average risk score (as so based). Prescribes requirements for preparation of the data necessary for such information, including standardized data elements and definitions. Requires a contract with a Medicare part C organization to provide the Secretary with the right to audit and inspect any pertinent book or record. Provides that, beginning in 2010, if an MA plan fails to have a medical loss ratio of at least .85, it will be subject to the following sanctions: (1) reduction of the blended benchmark amount; (2) no new enrollees for a specified period of time; and (3) termination of the plan contract if the plan fails to have such a medical loss for five consecutive contract years. Directs the Secretary to publish monthly the actual enrollment in each Medicare part C plan by contract and county. Requires the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MEDPAC) to study and report to Congress on the need and feasibility of providing for different minimum medical loss ratios for different types of Medicare part C plans.  \n    Subtitle\n    C\n     - \n    Quality and Other Provisions\n    \n    Section\n    421\n     - \n    \n    Requires any Medicare Advantage organization offering a private fee-for-service plan or an MSA plan for contract year 2009 to submit to the Secretary the same information on the same performance measures for which such information must be submitted for Medicare part C plans that are PPO plans for that year. Requires any such Medicare Advantage organization for contract year 2010 to submit to the Secretary the same performance measure information for which such information must be submitted for coordinated Medicare part C plans for that year. Requires employer-sponsored Medicare part C plans to have 90% of the Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the plan reside in a county in which the organization offers a Medicare part C local plan.  \n    Section\n    422\n     - \n    \n    Requires the Secretary to develop quality measures for Medicare part C plans that measure disparities in the amount and quality of health services provided to racial and ethnic minorities. Requires the Secretary to provide for Medicare part C organizations to submit data that permits analysis of such disparities, together with biennial reports to Congress on how quality assurance programs measure and report on them.  \n    Section\n    423\n     - \n    \n    Requires Medicare Advantage plan audits to cover plan information submitted for risk adjustment purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to take actions, including pursuit of financial recoveries, necessary to address deficiencies identified in an audit or other activities. Applies such authority of the Secretary to PDPs under Medicare part D.  \n    Section\n    424\n     - \n    \n    Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the adequacy of the Medicare Advantage risk adjustment system.  \n    Section\n    425\n     - \n    \n    Eliminates the providers' ability to bill enrollees in private fee-for-service plans more than the Medicare fee schedule amount. Repeals the exemption of private FFA plans from the Secretary's authority to review and negotiate Medicare Advantage plan bid amounts. (Thus authorizes the Secretary to review and negotiate the bid amounts for private FFS plans in the same manner as with other Medicare part C plans.)  \n    Section\n    426\n     - \n    \n    Renames the Medicare Advantage program as the Medicare part C program.  \n    Subtitle\n    D\n     - \n    Extension of Authorities\n    \n    Section\n    431\n     - \n    \n    Extends the authority to limit enrollment in special needs plans to only special needs beneficiaries for periods before January 1, 2012.
