Requires the NLRB, in making such determination, to consider functional integration, centralized control, common skills, functions and working conditions, permanent and temporary employee interchange, geographical separation, local autonomy, the number of employees, bargaining history, and other factors it considers appropriate.  \n    Title\n    III\n     - \n    Justice on Time\n    Requires the NLRB to state its findings of fact and to issue and serve corrective orders, including reinstatement of an employee with or without backpay, or issue an order dismissing the complaint, within 365 days after the filing of a charge of unfair labor practice involving an unlawful discharge, except in cases of extreme complexity. Directs the NLRB to report annually to specified congressional committees on any cases pending for more than one year, including an explanation of the factors contributing to such a delay, and recommendations for prompt resolution of such cases.  \n    Title\n    IV\n     - \n    Attorneys Fees\n    Provides for awards of attorney's fees and costs in administrative or court proceedings involving the NLRB, without regard to whether the NLRB's position was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust, if the prevailing parties are employers or labor organizations with no more than 100 employees and a net worth of no more than $1.4 million at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated."
