Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on whether: (1) the coverage of a parent, a caretaker relative, or a legal guardian of a targeted low-income child under a state CHIP health plan increases the enrollment of, or the quality of care for, children; and (2) such parents, relatives, and legal guardians who enroll in such a plan are more likely to enroll their children in such a plan or in a state Medicaid plan.  \n    Section\n    113\n     - \n    \n    Eliminates counting Medicaid child presumptive eligibility costs against CHIP allotment.  \n    Section\n    114\n     - \n    \n    Denies payments to states for new CHIP coverage of children with effective family income that exceeds 300% of the federal poverty line.

Makes appropriations for such report. Directs the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register, and post on the public Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) website: (1) recommendations regarding best practices for states to use to address CHIP crowd-out; and (2) uniform standards for data collection by states to measure and report health benefits coverage for children with family income below 200% of the poverty line, and on CHIP crowd-out, including for children with family income that exceeds 200% of the poverty line. Requires each state that submits a plan amendment (or waiver request) to provide for CHIP eligibility for higher income children (with effective family income exceeding 300% of the poverty line) to include with such plan amendment or request a description of how the state will: (1) address CHIP crowd-out; and (2) incorporate recommended best practices. Requires the Secretary to review each state plan amendment or waiver request submitted and determine whether: (1) it incorporates recommended best practices; and (2) the state meets the required enrollment targets, and, if a higher income state, meets the target rate for low-income children. Prohibits payments for higher income children to any state failing to meet the coverage target rate for low-income children. Authorizes a state to elect to limit CHIP eligibility to a targeted low-income child on the basis of the existence of a valid medical support order on the child's behalf, but only if the state does not deny such eligibility on that basis if the child asserts that the order is not being complied with for any one of specified reasons (unless none of them applies). Specifies such reasons for noncompliance with a medical support order as: (1) failure of the noncustodial parent to comply with the order; (2) failure of an employer, group health plan, or health insurance issuer to comply with such order; or (3) residence of the child in a geographic area in which CHIP benefits are generally unavailable.   \n    Title\n    II\n     - \n    Outreach and Enrollment\n    \n    Subtitle\n    A\n     - \n    Outreach and Enrollment Activities\n    \n    Section\n    201\n     - \n    \n    Amends SSA title XXI to direct the Secretary to award grants during FY2008-FY2012 for outreach and enrollment efforts to increase the enrollment and participation of eligible children under CHIP and Medicaid.

Amends SSA title XIX to authorize a federal or state agency or private entity in possession of the sources of data directly relevant for Medicaid eligibility determination (including eligibility files maintained by an Express Lane agency) to convey such information to the state Medicaid agency, if such conveyance meets specified requirements. Prescribes civil and criminal penalties for improper disclosure of such information. Directs the Secretary to enter into agreements necessary to permit a state that elects the Express Lane option to receive data directly relevant to determining eligibility and the correct amount of benefits under CHIP or Medicaid from: (1) the National Directory of New Hires; and (2) data regarding enrollment in insurance that may help to facilitate outreach and enrollment under the state Medicaid and CHIP plans and such other programs as the Secretary may specify.  \n    Subtitle\n    B\n     - \n    Reducing Barriers to Enrollment\n    \n    Section\n    211\n     - \n    \n    Gives states the option, as an alternative to the current documentation requirement, to verify a declaration of U.S. citizenship or nationality for purposes of Medicaid or CHIP eligibility through verification of a name and Social Security number with the Commissioner of Social Security.

Allows employers to opt-out of being paid the subsidy directly, in which event the state shall pay the employee. Amends SSA title XIX to allow a state to elect to offer a similar voluntary premium assistance subsidy for qualified employer-sponsored coverage to all individuals under age 19 entitled to Medicaid.
