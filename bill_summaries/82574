"2/5/2003--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since being introduced in the Senate on February 5, 2003. However, because action occurred on the measure, the summary has been expanded.) Declares that the Space Shuttle Columbia tragedy shall not dissuade or discourage this Nation from venturing ever farther into space. Restates the commitment to exploring the planets and celestial bodies of our solar system and beyond. Expresses condolences to the families of the seven astronauts and to friends and allies in Israel over the loss of Colonel Ilan Ramon, the first Israeli in space. Declares that we will never forget the sacrifices made by the seven heroes aboard Columbia and that we shall learn from this tragedy so that these sacrifices shall not have been in vain."
