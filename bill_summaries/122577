Conditions certain assistance, initially, on the convention of a Loya Jirga (traditional Afghan assembly), and later, on substantial progress toward a constitution and democratically elected government, unless the President certifies to Congress that the vital national interests of the United States require otherwise.  \n    Section\n    105\n     - \n    \n    Earmarks funds for assistance in the major opium producing regions, including areas within the Badakshan, Helmand, and Qandahar provinces, with the goal of eliminating poppy cultivation.

Declares that the administrative provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 shall apply to the same extent as they apply to certain other economic assistance.
