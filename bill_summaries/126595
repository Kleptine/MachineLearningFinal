Requires an independent counsel to: (1) conduct all activities with due regard for expense, authorize only reasonable and lawful expenditures, and (promptly upon taking office) assign to a specific employee the duty of certifying that expenditures of the independent counsel are reasonable and made in accordance with law; and (2) comply with the established policies of the Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding expenditures of funds, except to the extent that compliance would be inconsistent with the purposes of the Act. Directs: (1) the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to provide administrative support and guidance to each independent counsel; and (2) the Administrator of General Services to provide office space for each independent counsel. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) independent counsel per diem expenses; (2) independent counsel employee pay comparability; (3) ethics enforcement; (4) compliance with DOJ policies; (5) publication of reports; (6) annual reports to the Congress; (7) periodic reappointment of independent counsel; and (8) audits by the Comptroller General. Authorizes the Attorney General to conduct a preliminary investigation upon the receipt of information sufficient to constitute grounds to investigate whether a Member of Congress may have violated any Federal criminal law, other than a violation classified as a Class B or C misdemeanor or an infraction, when the Attorney General determines that it would be in the public interest. Includes as grounds for removal of an independent counsel physical or mental disability consistent with prohibitions on discrimination otherwise imposed by law (current law includes physical disability and mental incapacity). Requires an independent counsel to comply with guidelines and procedures used by DOJ in the handling and use of classified materials."
