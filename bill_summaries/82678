Amends Rule XVII (Decorum and Debate) to limit the prohibition against personal electronic equipment on the Floor of the House to wireless telephones and personal computers (thus allowing other personal electronic equipment, particularly unobtrusive handheld electronic devices).

Excludes the practice of medicine from the meaning of fiduciary relationship. (Thus allows dentists and physicians to earn outside income up to $22,500.) Requires that, in determining the value of an allowable gift to a Member's or House employee's office, perishable food sent as a gift to an office shall be allocated among the individual recipients and not to the Member. Makes an exemption for the gift ban for charity travel. Allows Members to be reimbursed for travel and lodging expenses by a charity organization, in cases where the net proceeds of the event go to a qualified charity, and the invitation is issued by the charity. Redesignates Rule XXVII (General Provisions) as Rule XXVIII. Sets forth a new Rule XXVII (Statutory Limit on Public Debt) (reinstating the \"Gephardt Rule,\" former Rule XXIII of the 106th Congress). Provides for automatic House passage of a joint resolution increasing the statutory limit on the public debt when the House agrees to a budget resolution that requires such an increase. States that: (1) the amount of the increase in the joint resolution conforms to the level established in the budget resolution; and (2) the final House vote on the budget resolution shall be deemed the vote on the joint resolution.  \n    Section\n    3\n     - \n    \n    Declares that references to resolutions in Sec. 306 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (prohibiting consideration of legislation within the Budget Committee's jurisdiction, unless reported by the Budget Committee) shall be construed as applying only to joint resolutions (as well as bills, but not to simple and concurrent resolutions). Makes a Sec. 303 point of order (requiring adoption of a budget resolution before consideration of budget-related legislation) applicable to text made in order as original bill by a special rule. States that a provision in a bill or joint resolution, or in an amendment thereto or a conference report thereon, that establishes prospectively for a Federal office or position a specified or minimum level of compensation to be funded by annual discretionary appropriations shall not be considered as providing new entitlement authority. States that the provisions of H.Con.Res. 353 (budget \"deeming\" resolution) as adopted by the House in the 107th Congress shall have effect in the 108th Congress until such time as a conference report establishing a budget for FY 2003 is adopted. Directs the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget to submit for printing in the Congressional Record specified allocations (including a certain one for Medicare) and accounts identified for advance appropriations, as well as an estimated unified surplus. Increases from five to six the maximum number of subcommittees authorized for the Committees on Armed Services, on International Relations, and on Transportation and Infrastructure.
