Specifies that a \"connection\" to a system that delivers water by a constructed conveyance other than a pipe shall not be considered a connection if: (1) the water is used exclusively for purposes other than residential uses; or (2) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or a State exercising primary enforcement responsibility for systems (primacy State) determines that alternative water to achieve the equivalent level of public health protection provided by the applicable national primary drinking water (NPDW) regulation is provided for residential or similar uses for drinking and cooking, or that the water provided for residential or similar uses for drinking, cooking, and bathing is centrally treated or treated at the point of entry by the provider, a pass-through entity, or the user to achieve the equivalent level of protection provided by the applicable NPDW regulations. Sets forth transition provisions regarding a water supplier that would be a system only as a result of modifications made under this Act. Directs the Comptroller General of the United States to undertake a study to: (1) ascertain the numbers and locations of individuals and households relying on irrigation water and other specified systems for their residential water needs; (2) determine the sources, costs, and affordability of water used for residential needs; and (3) review State and water system compliance with the Act. \n    Section\n    102\n     - \n    \n    Modifies the Act to require the Administrator to publish a maximum contaminant level (MCL) goal and promulgate an NPDW regulation for specified contaminants upon determining that: (1) the contaminant may have an adverse effect on the health of persons and is known to occur or there is a substantial likelihood that the contaminant will occur in systems with a frequency and at levels of public health concern; and (2) in the sole judgment of the Administrator, regulation of such contaminant presents a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction for persons served by systems. Directs the Administrator: (1) every five years, to publish a list of contaminants which are not subject to any proposed or promulgated NPDW, which are known or anticipated to occur in systems, and which may require regulation and to make determinations of whether to regulate not fewer than five contaminants; and (2) to select for consideration unregulated contaminants that present the greatest public health concern. Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) promulgate an interim NPDW regulation for a contaminant without making a required determination, or completing a required analysis, to address an urgent public health threat; and (2) publish health advisories or take other appropriate actions for contaminants not subject to any NPDW regulation. Sets forth provisions regarding schedules and deadlines for the publication of MCL goals and promulgation of NPDW regulations, including regarding substitution of contaminants and disinfectants and disinfection byproducts.  \n    Section\n    103\n     - \n    \n    Directs the Administrator: (1) to use the best available science in regulatory decision making, to ensure that the presentation of information on public health effects is comprehensive, informative, and understandable, and to prepare a health risk reduction and cost analysis for new regulations; (2) at the time an NPDW regulation is proposed, to publish a determination of whether the MCL benefits justify the costs; and (3) when issuing new regulations, to identify affordable treatment technologies for small systems serving populations of 3,300 to 10,000, populations of 500 to 3,300, and populations of 25 to 500, and to promulgate a regulation to govern the recycling of filter backwash water within the treatment process of a system.  \n    Section\n    106\n     - \n    \n    Authorizes a primacy State to establish treatment requirements as an alternative to filtration in the case of systems having uninhabited, undeveloped watersheds in consolidated ownership and having control over access to, and activities in, those watersheds if the State determines (and the Administrator concurs) that the quality of the source water and the alternative treatment requirements established by the State ensure greater removal or inactivation efficiencies of pathogenic organisms for which NPDW regulations have been promulgated or that are of public health concern than would be achieved by the combination of filtration and chlorine disinfection.  \n    Section\n    107\n     - \n    \n    Modifies the Act to require the Administrator to promulgate NPDW regulations requiring disinfection as a treatment technique for all systems at any time in the period beginning three years after enactment of this Act until the date on which the Administrator promulgates a Stage II rule making for disinfectants and disinfectant byproducts.  \n    Section\n    108\n     - \n    \n    Makes NPDW regulations effective three years after promulgation, with exceptions.  \n    Section\n    109\n     - \n    \n    Directs the Administrator to: (1) propose by January 1, 2000, and promulgate by January 1, 2001, an NPDW regulation for arsenic and to develop a comprehensive plan for a study in support of drinking water rule making to reduce the uncertainty in assessing health risks associated with exposure to low levels of arsenic. Requires the Administrator and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), prior to promulgating an NPDW regulation for sulfate, to jointly conduct an additional study to establish a reliable dose-response relationship for the adverse human health effects that may result from exposure to sulfate in drinking water. Directs the Administrator to: (1) arrange for the National Academy of Sciences to prepare a risk assessment for radon in drinking water and an analysis of health risk reduction benefits associated with various mitigation measures to reduce radon levels in indoor air; and (2) withdraw any NPDW regulation for radon proposed prior to enactment, propose an MCL goal and NPDW regulation, and promulgate a final NPDW regulation based on such assessment and analysis. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) alternative MCL levels for radon; and (2) development by States of multimedia programs to mitigate radon levels in indoor air.  \n    Section\n    111\n     - \n    \n    Directs the Administrator, concurrently with promulgating an NPDW regulation for a contaminant, to issue guidance or regulations describing the best treatment technologies or techniques or other means for the contaminant that the Administrator finds, after examination for efficacy under field conditions, are available and affordable for systems of varying size, considering the quality of the source water to be treated, subject to specified requirements.  \n    Section\n    112\n     - \n    \n    Modifies the Act to: (1) grant a State primary enforcement responsibility for systems during any period for which the Administrator determines that such State, not later than two years after NPDW regulations are promulgated, has adopted drinking water regulations which are no less stringent than the NPDW regulations, with two-year extensions permitted under specified circumstances; (2) require the Administrator to notify an appropriate local elected official prior to taking action to force a system to comply with Act requirements or commencing a civil suit (and increases civil penalties for violations of, or failure or refusal to comply with, any order issued by the Administrator in response to an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health); and (3) require each system owner or operator to give notice to its customers of the concentration level of any unregulated contaminant for which the Administrator has required public notice (but authorizes States to establish alternative notification requirements). Sets forth reporting requirements for the State and the Administrator. Directs the Administrator to issue regulations to require each community water system to mail to each customer of the system at least annually a report on the level of contaminants in the drinking water purveyed by that system (\"consumer confidence report\"), which shall also provide for an EPA toll-free hotline that consumers can call for more information. Authorizes the Governor of a State to determine not to apply such mailing requirement to a community water system serving fewer than 10,000 persons. Specifies that any community water system which is not required to meet such mailing requirement and which serves 500 persons or fewer, may elect not to comply, subject to specified requirements, including that it prepare an annual consumer confidence report and provide at least annual notice to each of its customers that such report is available upon request. Requires the Administrator of the Food and Drug Administration to publish for public notice and comment a draft study on the feasibility of appropriate methods, if any, of informing customers of the contents of bottled water.  \n    Section\n    115\n     - \n    \n    Modifies the Act to provide that: (1) a variance may be issued to a system on condition that it install the best technology, treatment techniques, or other means available (taking costs into consideration); and (2) a schedule prescribed for a system granted a variance shall be based upon an evaluation satisfactory to the State that indicates that alternative sources of water are not reasonably available to the system.  \n    Section\n    116\n     - \n    \n    Authorizes a primacy State to grant a variance for compliance with a requirement specifying an MCL or treatment technique contained in an NPDW regulation to systems serving 3,300 or fewer persons and, with the Administrator's approval, to systems serving between 3,300 and 10,000 persons, under specified circumstances.  \n    Section\n    117\n     - \n    \n    Authorizes a primacy State to exempt any system within the State's jurisdiction from any requirement respecting an MCL, any treatment technique requirement, or both, of an applicable NPDW regulation upon finding that, due to compelling factors, the system is unable to implement measures to develop an alternative source of water supply. Bars a system from receiving an exemption if it was granted a small system variance.  \n    Section\n    118\n     - \n    \n    Modifies the Act to expand lead ban provisions to prohibit: (1) the use of any pipe, pipe or plumbing fitting, or fixture, solder, or flux that is not lead free in the installation or repair of any system or any plumbing in a facility providing water for human consumption; (2) the sale (or other introduction into commerce), two years after enactment, of pipes and pipe or plumb fittings or fixtures that are not lead free, except for pipes that are used in manufacturing or industrial processing; and (3) persons in the business of selling plumbing supplies, except manufacturers, from selling solder or flux that is not lead free (and requires any person selling solder or flux that is not lead free to label the product to indicate that it is illegal to use such solder or flux in the installation or repair of any plumbing providing water for human consumption). Directs the Administrator: (1) to provide accurate and timely technical information and assistance to qualified third-party certifiers in the development of voluntary standards and testing protocols for the leaching of lead from new plumbing fittings and fixtures that are intended by the manufacturer to dispense water for human ingestion; and (2) within two years, if voluntary standards for lead leaching from new plumbing fittings and fixtures are not established within one year, to issue regulations setting a performance standard establishing maximum leaching levels for fixtures intended to dispense water for human consumption (and, alternatively, if regulations are required but not issued within five years, bans the use of such plumbing or fixtures that contain more than four percent lead).  \n    Section\n    119\n     - \n    \n    Provides that a State shall receive only 80 percent of the allotment that the State is otherwise entitled under provisions regarding State loan funds unless the State has obtained the legal authority or other means to ensure that all new community water systems and new nontransient, noncommunity water systems commencing operation after October 1, 1999, demonstrate technical, managerial, and financial capacity with respect to each NPDW regulation in effect, or likely to be in effect, on the date of commencement of operations.
