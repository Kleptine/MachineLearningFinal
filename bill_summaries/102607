Deems such uranium hexafluoride to be of Russian origin. Requires the Secretary to sell, and receive payment for, the transferred uranium hexafluoride: (1) for overfeeding in the operations of enrichment facilities in the United States; (2) for end use outside the United States; (3) in 1995 and 1996 to the Russian Executive Agent at the purchase price for use in matched sales under the Suspension Agreement; or (4) for consumption by end users in the United States during calendar year 2001, according to a specified schedule beginning in 1998.

Arctic Coastal Plain Leasing and Revenue Act of 1995 - Instructs the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary), acting through the Bureau of Land Management, to implement a competitive leasing program for oil and gas exploration, development and production within the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  \n    Section\n    5333\n     - \n    \n    Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 to repeal its proscription against oil and gas production, leases, or development from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Declares that the Congress determines that such leasing program is compatible with the purposes for which the Refuge was established, and that no further findings or decisions are required to implement this directive (thereby avoiding statutorily-mandated environmental determinations). Declares this subtitle the sole authority for coastal plain leasing. Considers such coastal plain \"Federal land\" for purposes of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982. Authorizes the Secretary to designate a specified maximum acreage as Special Areas closed to leasing if the Secretary determines that such Areas are of such unique character as to require special management and regulatory protection. Authorizes the leasing of those Areas, however, by setting lease terms that limit surface use and occupancy but permit the use of horizontal drilling technology from sites on leases located outside the designated Special Areas. Declares that the Secretary's sole authority to close lands within the Coastal Plain to oil and gas leasing and to exploration, development and production is that set forth in this subtitle.
