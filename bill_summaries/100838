Specifies the contents of such registration. Provides for exemptions from registration requirements above in cases involving lobbying income of $5,000 or less (for a particular client) or total expenses of $20,000 or less (in the case of an organization whose employees engage in lobbying activities on the organization's behalf) (adjusted periodically for inflation) for the semiannual period.  \n    Section\n    5\n     - \n    \n    Requires registrants to file semiannual lobbying activity reports with the appropriate congressional officials.
