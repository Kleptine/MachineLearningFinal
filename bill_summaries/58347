Directs the Secretary to allow the Pell Grant basic amount to be exceeded for students participating in a program of study abroad approved for credit by the institution at which the student is enrolled when reasonable costs of such program are greater than the cost of attendance at the home institution, within the limits of the maximum grant levels specified in the appropriate appropriation Act. Prohibits any Pell Grant to an incarcerated student: (1) in an amount exceeding normal tuition and fees plus an allowance for books and supplies; (2) if it is used to supplant, rather than supplement, the State's FY 1988 level of postsecondary education assistance to incarcerated individuals; or (3) if the individual is serving under a death sentence or a life sentence without eligibility for parole or release.

Requires that such notice identify the additional amount that would be required to be appropriated to satisfy full all such award entitlements as so calculated at such maximum grant level. (But does not make the Pell Grant program an \"entitlement\" program which would give each qualified student a contractual right against the United States for the amount to which the student is entitled under Pell Grant provisions.) Provides that Pell Grant recipients shall not be considered to be individual grantees for purposes of specified Federal law. Repeals specified provisions for a separate need analysis formula for Pell Grants. (Later in this Act, a single new need analysis formula and system is established for all title IV student aid programs, including Pell Grants.)

Adds to permissible services: (1) mentoring programs involving college faculty and/or students; and (2) exposure to cultural events and academic programs not usually available to disadvantaged students. Allows costs for summer room and board, summer tuition, and transportation to summer programs to be paid in addition to the maximum annual amount for a student stipend. Eliminates provisions which: (1) conditioned program funding on specified minimum funding for other programs; and (2) set program funding limits. Reserves a specified minimum amount of TRIO funds for the McNair program in each of FY 1993 through 1997. Revises provisions for Educational Opportunity Centers (under TRIO programs provisions).

Establishes a National Early Intervention Scholarship and Partnership Program (as chapter 2 of the new subpart 2). Authorizes the Secretary to establish such program through matching payments to States for: (1) State financial aid programs that award grants to low-income students who attain a high school diploma or its equivalent to guarantee them the financial assistance necessary to attend an institution of higher education (the scholarship component); and (2) partnership programs (provided by States in cooperation with local educational agencies, postsecondary institutions, and community organizations) of additional counseling, mentoring, academic support, outreach, and supportive services for elementary, middle, and secondary students at risk of dropping out of school and for students and their parents regarding college financing options (the early intervention component). Requires State plans for such program to provide for: (1) at least one-half of program costs from non-Federal funds; (2) specifying the methods (among various alternatives) by which such matching share will be paid; and (3) assuring supplementation (not supplanting) of funds expended for existing State and local programs. Sets forth conditions States must meet in order to receive payments for the early intervention component of the program.

Requires States to give priority in awarding such scholarships to students who will receive a Pell Grant for the academic year for which the scholarship award is made. Requires, if program appropriations are less than a specified amount for any fiscal year, that program funds be distributed as competitive grants to States for that fiscal year. Requires, if such appropriations reach or exceed such amount, that program allotments be made to each State on the basis of its relative allocation under the chapter 1 program for educationally disadvantaged students under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Prohibits a State from using less than 25 percent or more than 50 percent of its program allotment for the early intervention component (but allows waiver of the 50 percent maximum limit if the State demonstrates it has another means of providing the tuition assistance in its plan).

Provides for reductions of such awards in cases of insufficient appropriations. Authorizes the Secretary to award such scholarships to eligible students for four years of undergraduate study at any institution of higher education (or five years if the undergraduate course of study requires five full-time academic years).

Bases eligibility after the first year on the student's maintaining eligibility to receive a Pell Grant, including fulfilling specified requirements for satisfactory academic progress. Conditions student eligibility also on: (1) secondary school graduation or its equivalent; (2) admission to or enrollment in an institution of higher education, not later than three years after secondary school graduation or its equivalent; and (3) eligibility to receive a Pell Grant.

Includes students in programs of study abroad that are approved for credit by the institution at which they are enrolled among those eligible for supplemental grants. Allows a supplemental grant to exceed the maximum amount of $4,000 by as much as $400 if reasonable study abroad costs exceed the cost of attendance at the home institution. Requires institutions in the supplemental grants program to agree that the Federal share of awards will not exceed 75 percent, unless the Secretary determines that a larger Federal share is required to further the purpose of the program. Requires institutions to assure that selection procedures will be designed to award supplemental grants, first, to students with exceptional need (i.e. the greatest financial need). Requires that a reasonable proportion of an institution's supplemental grants allocation be made available to certain nontraditional students (i.e. less than full-time or independent students), if such allocation is directly or indirectly based in part on the financial need of such students. Provides for an additional amount to be allocated under specified conditions under the supplemental grants program to eligible institutions from which 50 percent or more of the Pell Grant recipients attending such institution graduate or transfer to a four-year institution of higher education.
