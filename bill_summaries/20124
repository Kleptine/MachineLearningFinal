"9/7/2000--Passed House amended. Amends specified Federal law to authorize appropriations without fiscal year limitations for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. (Current law authorizes appropriations through FY 2000 for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council.) Continues the Council, but transfers some of its functions to the Museum. Directs the Chairperson of the Council to appoint a Museum Director who will be the Museum's chief executive officer and serve at the Council's pleasure. (Current law provides, instead, for appointment of an Executive Director of the Council.) Requires the Museum Director's annual report to Congress to include an examination of the Federal role in the funding of the Museum and its activities, and any changes that may be warranted."
