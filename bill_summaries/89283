"7/20/1990--Introduced. Declares that Senator David F. Durenberger's conduct was clearly and unequivocally unethical and therefore he is: (1) denounced by the United States Senate; (2) referred to the Republican Party Conference for attention; (3) directed to reimburse a specified sum plus interest to the Senate; and (4) required to pay to charities with which he has no affiliation a specified sum (less State and Federal taxes previously paid on that amount), including excessive honoraria improperly retained during 1985 and 1986. Requires such payments to be made at regular intervals over the balance of his United States Senate term."
