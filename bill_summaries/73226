Declares that, if a committee other than the Committee on Appropriations reports legislation that decreases direct spending (budget authority and outlays) for any fiscal year and also that authorizes appropriations for the same purpose, upon the enactment of such measure, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget may decrease the allocation to such committee and increase the allocation of discretionary spending to the Committee on Appropriations for FY2012 and the applicable discretionary spending limits by an amount equal to the new budget authority and outlays provided for in legislation making appropriations for the same purpose.  \n    Section\n    405\n     - \n    \n    Makes it out of order in the House to consider legislation reported out of committee (other than the Committee on Appropriations) if it has the net effect of increasing mandatory spending in excess of $5 billion for any of the first four consecutive 10-fiscal-year periods beginning with the first fiscal year following the last fiscal year for which the applicable budget resolution sets forth appropriate budgetary levels.  \n    Section\n    406\n     - \n    \n    Requires the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on any budget resolution to include in its allocation to the House Committee on Appropriations amounts for the discretionary administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration (SSA) and of the Postal Service. Authorizes the chairman to adjust allocations and aggregates for legislation reported by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that reforms the federal retirement system, but does not cause a net increase in the deficit for FY2012-FY2021.  \n    Section\n    408\n     - \n    \n    Requires any CBO estimate prepared for a measure under the Federal Credit Reform Act also to provide, as a supplement, and to the extent practicable, upon the request of the chairman or ranking member of the Committee on the Budget, an estimate of the current actual or estimated market values representing the \"fair value\" of assets and liabilities affected by such measure.
