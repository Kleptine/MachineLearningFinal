"5/9/1995--Introduced. Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) it regrets that negotiations between the United States and Japan for reductions in trade imbalances in automotive sales and parts, through the elimination of restrictive Japanese market-closing practices, have collapsed; and (2) if negotiations fail to open the Japanese auto parts market, it supports the President's decision to impose sanctions on Japanese products."
