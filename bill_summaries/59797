Authorizes the Secretary to enter into a cooperative agreement with Fairleigh Dickinson University to provide financial assistance for the costs of constructing and equipping a Riverine Laboratory and Environmental Technology Management Center in Madison, New Jersey, for training specialists in managing large-scale technology efforts in water resources and other program areas to improve the effective use of resources. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Secretary to participate as an active Federal member in the Memorandum of Understanding for the Interagency Ecological Study Program for implementation of the monitoring requirements in the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary, California. Amends the Water Resource Development Act of 1988 to authorize the Secretary to design and implement a comprehensive flood warning and response system to serve communities and flood prone areas along the Juniata River and its tributaries in Pennsylvania (as under current law) at full Federal expense (currently, consistent with the cost sharing policies of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986). Authorizes and directs the Secretary to carry out a project for the removal of silt and for the control of point and nonpoint sources of pollution from Woodbridge Creek, New Jersey. Deletes provisions of specified Acts authorizing and directing the Secretary to use funds for activities authorized by the Follow Through Act to develop, at full Federal expense, detailed plans and specifications and to construct measures in Tarrant County, Texas, to eliminate flood damage in the historical stockyards area along Tony's Creek and Marine Creek.
