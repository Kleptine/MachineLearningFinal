Authorizes the use of American military force to enforce the United Nations economic embargo against Iraq, defend Saudi Arabia from direct Iraqi attack, and protect American forces in the region. Pledges continued support for sustaining the policy of increasing economic and diplomatic pressure against Iraq, maintaining U.S. military options, and seeking to increase the military and financial contributions made by allied nations. Declares that: (1) the Constitution vests all power to declare war in the Congress; and (2) the Congress will expeditiously consider any presidential request for a declaration of war or for authority to use military force against Iraq.
