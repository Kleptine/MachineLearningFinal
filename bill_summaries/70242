Eliminates the special rule for 2012 limiting the amount of wages eligible for such tax rate reduction.  \n    Title\n    II\n     - \n    Unemployment Benefit Continuation and Program Improvement\n    Extended Benefits, Reemployment, and Program Integrity Improvement Act - \n    Subtitle\n    A\n     - \n    Reforms of Unemployment Compensation to Promote Work and Job Creation\n    \n    Section\n    2101\n     - \n    \n    Amends title III (Grants to States for Unemployment Compensation Administration) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to require state unemployment compensation (UC) laws to require, as a condition of eligibility for regular compensation for any week, that an UC claimant be able to work, available to work, and actively seeking work.  \n    Section\n    2102\n     - \n    \n    Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to enter into agreements with up to 10 states to allow them to conduct demonstration projects to test and evaluate measures designed to: (1) expedite the reemployment of individuals who establish initial eligibility for UC under state law, or (2) improve the effectiveness of a state in carrying out its state law with respect to reemployment.  \n    Section\n    2103\n     - \n    \n    Amends the Internal Revenue Code and the SSA title III to require states (which, currently, are merely authorized) to reduce current unemployment benefits to recover prior unemployment benefit overpayments. Amends the SSA to authorize a state to reduce current unemployment benefits to recover prior federal additional compensation overpayments and prior unemployment benefit overpayments of another state.  \n    Section\n    2104\n     - \n    \n    Amends the SSA title IX (Miscellaneous Provisions Relating to Employment Security) to require the Secretary to designate a data exchange standard for any category of information required for data matching in the federal-state unemployment insurance system.  \n    Section\n    2105\n     - \n    \n    Amends the SSA title III to declare that nothing in such Act or any other federal law shall be considered to prevent a state from enacting legislation to provide for: (1) testing an UC applicant for the unlawful use of controlled substances as a condition for receiving UC, if such applicant was terminated from employment most recently because of such use or is an individual for whom suitable work is only available in an occupation that regularly conducts drug testing; or (2) denying UC to the applicant on the basis of such test result.  \n    Subtitle\n    B\n     - \n    Provisions Relating to Extended Benefits\n    Unemployment Benefits Extension Act of 2012 - \n    Section\n    2122\n     - \n    \n    Amends the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 (SSA, 2008) with respect to the state-established individual emergency unemployment compensation account (EUCA). Extends the final date for entering a federal-state agreement under the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program through January 2, 2013. Repeals current transitional requirements for an individual's remaining EUCA payments. Revises the triggers for Tier-2, Tier-3, and Tier-4 augmentation payments to an individual's EUCA . Modifies the duration of the state availability of Tier-1, Tier-2, Tier-3, and Tier-4 of the EUC program during: (1) March-May 2012, (2) June-August 2012, and (3) September-December 2012.  \n    Section\n    2123\n     - \n    \n    Amends the Assistance for Unemployed Workers and Struggling Families Act to extend until December 31, 2012, requirements that federal payments to states cover 100% of EUC. Amends the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2008 to exempt weeks of unemployment between enactment of this Act and June 30, 2013, from the prohibition in the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 (FSEUCA of 1970) against federal matching payments to a state for the first week in an individual's eligibility period for which extended compensation or sharable regular compensation is paid if the state law provides for payment of regular compensation to an individual for his or her first week of otherwise compensable unemployment. (Thus allows temporary federal matching for the first week of extended benefits for states with no waiting period.) Amends the FSEUCA of 1970 to postpone similarly from February 29, 2012, to December 31, 2012, termination of the period during which a state may determine its \"on\" and \"off\" indicators according to specified temporary substitutions in its formula.  \n    Section\n    2124\n     - \n    \n    Amends the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act to extend through December 31, 2012, the temporary increase in extended unemployment benefits for employees with 10 or more years of service as well as for those with less than 10.  \n    Subtitle\n    C\n     - \n    Improving Reemployment Strategies Under the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program\n    \n    Section\n    2141\n     - \n    \n    Amends the SSA, 2008 to allow a state agency to make EUC payments to individuals who are able to work, available to work, and actively seeking work.  \n    Section\n    2142\n     - \n    \n    Includes in a federal-state agreement a requirement that a state provide reemployment services and reemployment eligibility assessment activities to certain recipients of EUC. Conditions an individual's continuing eligibility for EUC for any week on whether such individual has been referred to such services or activities and participated, or has completed such participation, unless there is justifiable cause for failure to do so. Makes FY2012-FY2013 appropriations for such services and activities.  \n    Section\n    2143\n     - \n    \n    Requires a state agency (which, currently, is merely authorized) to recover an EUC overpayment to an individual by deductions from such individual's EUC payment during the three-year period after such individual received the EUC payment to which he or she was not entitled.  \n    Section\n    2144\n     - \n    \n    Makes the nonreduction rule inapplicable for a state that has enacted a law before March 1, 2012, that, upon taking effect, would violate such rule. (Thus allows a particular federal-state EUC agreement to be effective for a state even though it passes a law that would modify the method for computing regular compensation so that the average weekly benefit amount of regular compensation payable during the period of the agreement on or after June 2, 2010, will be less than the average weekly benefit amount that otherwise would be payable during that period under state law as in effect on June 2, 2010. The \"nonreduction rule\" declares that a federal-state EUC agreement shall not apply, or shall cease to apply, to such a state.)  \n    Subtitle\n    D\n     - \n    Short-Time Compensation Program\n    Layoff Prevention Act of 2012 - \n    Section\n    2160\n     - \n    \n    Amends the Internal Revenue Code to set forth requirements relating to short-time compensation programs to allow employers to reduce the workweek of their employees in lieu of layoffs. Provides for federal financing of state short-time compensation programs.  \n    Section\n    2164\n     - \n    \n    Requires the Secretary of Labor to: (1) award grants to states that enact such programs; (2) develop model legislative language for use by states in developing, enacting, and implementing such programs; and (3) report to Congress and the President on their implementation.  \n    Subtitle\n    E\n     - \n    Self-Employment Assistance\n    \n    Section\n    2181\n     - \n    \n    - Amends the FSEUCA of 1970 to authorize states to establish a self-employment assistance program (a program to provide unemployed individuals with an allowance in lieu of EUC to establish a business and become self-employed). Allows a participant in a self-employment assistance program to opt to discontinue such participation. Amends the SSA, 2008 to authorize the federal-state agreement to require that a state agency administering EUC establish a self-employment assistance program to provide for the payment of EUC for up to 26 weeks as self-employment assistance allowances to individuals who meet specified eligibility criteria. Allows a participant in a self-employment assistance program to opt to discontinue such participation.  \n    Section\n    2182\n     - \n    \n    Directs the Secretary of Labor to: (1) award grants to states for self-employment assistance programs; (2) develop model language that may be used by states in enacting such programs and provide technical assistance to states in establishing, improving, and administering such programs; (3) establish reporting requirement for states that have established such programs; and (4) report to Congress on the effectiveness of such programs. Makes appropriations for such grants for FY2012-FY2013.  \n    Section\n    2183\n     - \n    \n    Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop model language that may be used by states in enacting such programs; and (2) provide technical assistance and guidance in establishing, improving, and administering the programs. Requires the Secretary to use resources available through the Department of Labor and coordinate with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to ensure that adequate funding is reserved and made available for entrepreneurial training to individuals participating in self-employment assistance programs.   \n    Title\n    III\n     - \n    Temporary Extension of Health Provisions\n    \n    Subtitle\n    A\n     - \n    Medicare Extensions\n    \n    Section\n    3001\n     - \n    \n    Amends the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 to extend section 508 hospital reclassifications for four months through March 31, 2012. (\"Section 508\" refers to Section 508 of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 [MMA], which allows the temporary reclassification of a hospital with a low Medicare area wage index, for reimbursement purposes, to a nearby location with a higher Medicare area wage index, so that the \"Section 508 hospital\" will receive the higher Medicare reimbursement rate.)  \n    Section\n    3002\n     - \n    \n    Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA), as amended by the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011, to extend through December 31, 2012, hold harmless provisions under the prospective payment system (PPS) for hospital outpatient department (OPD) services.  \n    Section\n    3003\n     - \n    \n    Extends through all of 2012 the freeze in the physician payment update made for the first two months of 2012.

Requires that certain relocation cost reimbursements be made to reassigned broadcast television licensees, related multichannel video programming distributors, and incumbent users of channel 37 (a band of spectrum currently reserved for radio astronomy and wireless medical telemetry service) under specified conditions. Authorizes waivers from FCC flexible use service rules in lieu of such reimbursements. Prohibits reimbursements for lost revenue. Directs the FCC to conduct a broadcast television spectrum auction in which it assigns licenses for the reallocated spectrum. Requires that the proceeds shared with each licensee whose bid the FCC accepts in the reverse auction be at least the amount of such bid. Prohibits reassignments or reallocations from becoming effective, and bars the FCC from assigning such licenses and revoking spectrum usage rights, if the proceeds from the auction are below the reverse auction bid amount. Establishes the TV Broadcaster Relocation Fund. Authorizes the FCC to borrow up to a specified amount from the Treasury to deposit into the Fund for the payment of relocation costs. Requires the FCC to reimburse the Treasury as funds are deposited in the Fund. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, if amounts remain in the Fund three years after the auction, to transfer such amounts to: (1) the Public Safety Trust Fund through FY2022, and (2) the Treasury's general fund for the sole purpose of deficit reduction after FY2022.
