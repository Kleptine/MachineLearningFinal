"8/11/1997--Line item veto by President. (On June 25, 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that the Line Item Veto Act (Public Law 104-130) is unconstitutional, thus restoring provisions that had been cancelled as summarized below.) (On August 11, 1997, the President line-item-vetoed Sec. 968 and Sec. 1175. Sec. 968 would have provided for the nonrecognition of the gain on the sale of stock of a qualified domestic refiner or processor of agricultural or horticultural products to an eligible farmers' cooperative engaged in the marketing of agricultural or horticultural products. Sec. 1175 would have allowed, during calendar year 1998, a tax exemption for income earned in connection with the active conduct of foreign financial services businesses. The following revised digest of H.R. 2014 reflects the Act as signed into law, minus the line-item-vetoed provisions. For more information on the specific items vetoed, see the text of the conference report for H.R. 2014, H. Rept. 105-220, and the Presidential Cancellation Numbers 97-1 and 97-2) TABLE OF CONTENTS: \n    Title\n    I\n     - \n    Child Tax Credit Title II: Education Incentives Expenses Subtitle A: Tax Benefits Relating to Education Expenses Subtitle B: Expanded Education Investment Savings Opportunities Subtitle C: Other Education Initiatives Title III: Savings and Investment Incentives Subtitle A: Retirement Savings Subtitle B: Capital Gains Title IV: Alternative Minimum Tax Reform Title V: Estate, Gift, and Generation-Skipping Tax Provisions Subtitle A: Estate and Gift Tax Provisions Subtitle B: Generation-Skipping Tax Provision Title VI: Extensions Title VII: Incentives for Revitalization of the District of Columbia Title VIII: Welfare-to-Work Incentives Title IX: Miscellaneous Provisions Subtitle A: Provisions Relating to Excise Taxes Subtitle B: Revisions Relating Disasters Subtitle C: Provisions Relating to Employment Taxes Subtitle D: Provisions Relating to Small Businesses Subtitle E: Brownfields Subtitle F: Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities, Brownfields, and Community Development Financial Institutions Subtitle G: Other Provisions Subtitle H: Extension of Duty-Free Treatment Under Generalized System of Preferences Title X: Revenues Subtitle A: Financial Products Subtitle B: Corporate Organizations and Reorganizations Subtitle C: Administrative Provisions Subtitle D: Excise and Employment Tax Provisions Subtitle E: Provisions Relating to Tax-Exempt Entities Subtitle F: Foreign Provisions Subtitle G: Partnership Provisions Subtitle H: Pension Provisions Subtitle I: Other Revenue Provisions Title XI: Simplification and Other Foreign-Related Provisions Subtitle A: General Provisions Subtitle B: Treatment of Controlled Foreign Corporations Subtitle C: Treatment of Passive Foreign Investment Companies Subtitle D: Repeal of Excise Tax on Transfers to Foreign Entities Subtitle E: Information Reporting Subtitle F: Determination of Foreign or Domestic Status of Partnerships Subtitle G: Other Simplification Provisions Subtitle H: Other Provisions Title XII: Simplification Provisions Relating to Individuals and Businesses Subtitle A: Provisions Relating to Individuals Subtitle B: Provisions Relating to Businesses Generally Subtitle C: Simplification Relating to Electing Large Partnerships Subtitle D: Provisions Relating to Real Estate Investment Trusts Subtitle E: Provisions Relating to Regulated Investment Companies Subtitle F: Taxpayer Protections Title XIII: Simplification Provisions Relating to Estate and Gift Taxes Title XIV: Simplification Provisions Relating to Excise Taxes, Tax-Exempt Bonds, and Other Matters Subtitle A: Excise Tax Simplification Subtitle B: Tax-Exempt Bond Provisions Subtitle C: Tax Court Procedures Subtitle D: Other Provisions Title XV: Pensions and Employee Benefits Subtitle A: Simplification Subtitle B: Other Provisions Relating to Pensions and Employee Benefits Subtitle C: Provisions Relating to Certain Health Acts Subtitle D: Provisions Relating to Plan Amendments Title XVI: Technical Amendments Related to Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 and Other Legislation Title XVII: Identification of Limited Tax Benefits Subject to Line Item Veto Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997\n     \n    Title\n    I\n     - \n    Child Tax Credit\n    Amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow a tax credit of up to $500 dollars for each qualifying child of a taxpayer, beginning in taxable years starting after December 31, 1997.  \n    Title\n    II\n     - \n    Education Incentives\n    \n    Subtitle\n    A\n     - \n    Tax Benefits Relating to Education Expenses\n    Creates a credit equal to the sum of the: (1) Hope Scholarship Credit; plus (2) Lifetime learning Credit.
