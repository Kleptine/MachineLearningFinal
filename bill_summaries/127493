"5/25/1993--Passed House amended. Resolution Authorizing the Use of United States Armed Forces in Somalia - Expresses support for United Nations (UN) efforts in Somalia. Commends the armed forces for successfully establishing a secure environment for the humanitarian relief operations in Somalia. Authorizes the President to use the armed forces to implement UN Security Council Resolutions 794 (which authorizes the use of all necessary means to establish a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations in Somalia) and 814 (which provides for the establishment of the UN-led force there). Declares that this Act is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization for the use of U.S. troops under the War Powers Resolution. Terminates such authorization at the earlier of: (1) the end of 12 months after enactment of this Act unless extended by the Congress; or (2) expiration of the mandate of the UN-led force in Somalia. Directs the President to report to the Congress regarding: (1) armed forces participation in and support for the UN-led force in Somalia; (2) transition to a UN-led force; (3) any agreements with the UN regarding use of the armed forces in Somalia; and (4) costs of UN-authorized operations in that country. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should seek to ensure that incremental costs incurred by the United States in connection with the United States- and UN-led forces in Somalia are reimbursed to the maximum extent possible by the UN and other members of the international community."
