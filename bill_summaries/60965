Authorizes the Director, without the review or approval of the Secretary of HUD, to: (1) issue regulations for the financial health and security of the enterprises, including the establishment of capital standards; (2) examine each enterprise's financial and operating condition; (3) determine capital levels of the enterprises; (4) undertake administrative and enforcement actions; (5) appoint conservators of the enterprises; (6) monitor and enforce compliance with housing goals; and (7) conduct research and financial analysis. Authorizes the Director, subject to the Secretary's review and approval, to issue regulations: (1) concerning the housing finance missions of the enterprises, including affordable housing; and (2) establishing and monitoring compliance with fair lending requirements. Subjects the introduction of any new program by an enterprise to prior approval by both the Director and the Secretary. Allows an adequately capitalized enterprise to introduce a new program with notice to the Director and the Secretary. Exempts such a new program from approval by the Director; and deems it approved by the Secretary within 20 days after submission unless the Secretary determines there is substantial probability the program is not authorized by the relevant charter Act or would have a deleterious effect on housing finance. Authorizes the Director to levy annual assessments on the enterprises (payable semiannually) for the estimated expenses of the Office, including an initial assessment to cover its start-up costs. Permits the Director, in his or her discretion, to increase an enterprise's semiannual payment, to cover additional estimated regulation and enforcement costs, if the enterprise is not adequately capitalized. Requires the Director to report annually to the Secretary of HUD and specified congressional committees. Requires each enterprise to report quarterly and annually to the Director on its financial condition and operations. Requires each enterprise to have an annual independent audit made of its financial statements by an independent public accountant.

Amends the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act to prohibit the Secretary from merging or consolidating the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or any of its functions or responsibilities, with any function or program the Secretary administers. Prohibits the Director and any former officer or employee of the Office, who was compensated at certain levels higher than GS-15 while employed by the Office, from accepting compensation from any enterprise during the two years following separation from the Office. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed: (1) as obligating the Federal Government, either directly or indirectly, to provide any funds to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, or to honor, reimburse, or otherwise guarantee any of their obligations or liabilities; or (2) as implying that either enterprise or its securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.

Requires the Director to prohibit an enterprise from providing excessive compensation to any executive officer.  \n    Title\n    II\n     - \n    Requires Capital Levels for Enterprises and Special Enforcement Powers\n    Requires the Director to establish by regulation a risk-based capital test which shall require each enterprise to maintain positive capital during a ten-year period (\"stress period\") in which specified circumstances occur with respect to credit risk, interest rate risk, and new enterprise business. Declares that the risk-based capital level for an enterprise shall be 130 percent of the amount of capital required to meet the risk-based capital test. Requires the minimum capital level for each enterprise to be the sum of: (1) 2.5 percent of its aggregate on-balance sheet assets; (2) 0.45 percent of the unpaid principal balance of outstanding mortgage-backed securities and substantially equivalent instruments issued or guaranteed by it that are not included in (1); and (3) those percentages of other off-balance sheet obligations not included in (2) (excluding certain commitments), that best reflect the credit risk of such obligations or guarantees in relation to the instruments included in (2). Requires the critical capital level for each enterprise to be the sum of: (1) 1.25 percent of the aggregate on-balance sheet assets of the enterprise; (2) 0.25 percent of the unpaid principal balance of outstanding mortgage-backed securities and substantially equivalent instruments issued or guaranteed by it that are not included in (1); and (3) those percentages of other off-balance sheet obligations not included in (2) (excluding certain commitments), that best reflect the credit risk of such obligations or guarantees in relation to the instruments included in (2). Requires the Director to classify, on a quarterly basis, each enterprise as adequately capitalized (meeting or exceeding both its risk-based capital level and its minimum capital level), undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized. Requires undercapitalized and significantly undercapitalized enterprises to submit capital restoration plans to the Director and, after approval, carry them out. Prohibits such enterprises from making any capital distribution that would result in a lower classification. Authorizes the Director, in the event an enterprise fails to submit a substantially compliant plan, win approval for a submitted plan, or make reasonable good-faith efforts to comply with an approved plan, to: (1) reclassify an undercapitalized enterprise as significantly undercapitalized, or a significantly undercapitalized enterprise as critically undercapitalized; and (2), with respect to significantly undercapitalized enterprises, limit increases in obligations, limit or prohibit asset growth, restrict certain activities, require new capital, and (in certain circumstances) appoint a conservator. Requires the Director to appoint a conservator for a critically undercapitalized enterprise, unless the public interest would be better served by some other enforcement action.

Provides for judicial review of certain classifications or supervisory enforcement actions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Requires the Director, for each enterprise, to contract with two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations: (1) to assess and rate, as a traditional credit rating, the likelihood that the enterprise will be unable to meet its obligations from its own resources with an assumption that there is no recourse to any implicit Government guarantee; and (2) to review the enterprise's rating as frequently as appropriate, but at least annually. Requires submission of comments to specified congressional committees on any difference between the Office's evaluation and the evaluation of the rating organizations, especially about capital adequacy. Requires the Director to define by regulation the meaning of \"capital,\" excluding any amounts that an enterprise could be required to pay, at the option of investors, to retire capital instruments.  \n    Title\n    III\n     - \n    Enforcement Actions\n    Sets forth general procedures for: (1) issuing temporary and permanent cease-and-desist orders against enterprises; (2) hearings; (3) judicial review; (4) three-tiered civil money penalties; (5) notice after separation from service; (7) private rights of action; and (8) public disclosure of final orders and agreements.  \n    Title\n    IV\n     - \n    Conservatorship\n    Provides a procedure for the appointment of a conservator if: (1) an enterprise is in an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business, and such condition threatens the enterprise's viability or a depletion of substantially all of its capital; (2) the enterprise has concealed or is concealing its books, records, or assets, or refuses to submit them for proper inspection; or (3) the enterprise has willfully violated or is willfully violating a final cease-and-desist order.

Requires each enterprise to appoint an Affordable Housing Advisory Council to advise it on possible methods to promote affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families. Amends the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act to: (1) make it a purpose of such Acts to promote access to mortgage credit throughout the Nation (including central cities and rural areas) by increasing the liquidity of mortgage investments, including facilitating credit secured by mortgages to secondary market participants, and improving the distribution of investment capital available for residential mortgage financing; (2) indicate that each of their respective public purposes relates to both single-family and multifamily housing; and (3) require that at least one presidentially appointed member of each enterprise's board of directors has demonstrated a career commitment to the provision of low-income housing.

Requires the Board of Directors of each Federal Home Loan Bank to submit to the Congress its evaluation of the costs and benefits of consolidating the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Requires the Federal Home Loan Banks to set up a Study Committee to study and report to specified congressional committees, the Federal Housing Finance Board, and the presidents of the Federal Home Loan Banks on the same topics covered by the above study. Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to require that all Board directors shall serve on a full-time basis beginning January 1, 1994. Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to declare that an advance to a State housing finance agency for the purpose of facilitating mortgage lending that benefits individuals and families meeting certain income requirements need not be collateralized by a mortgage insured under title II of the National Housing Act if the advance otherwise meets specified requirements of the Act and any real estate collateral for such comprises single family or multifamily residential mortgages.  \n    Title\n    VIII\n     - \n    Study of National Consumer Cooperative Bank\n    Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to specified congressional committees on: (1) the extent to which the National Consumer Cooperative Bank has achieved its statutory purposes under the National Consumer Cooperative Bank Act; and (2) the financial safety and soundness of the activities of the Bank and its affiliates.

Prohibits any such investment if it would expose the bank to unlimited liability. Requires the Comptroller General or the Federal Reserve Board, as appropriate, to limit the investment in any one project. Limits the aggregate investment of a bank to the sum of ten percent of its paid-in, unimpaired stock plus ten percent of its unimpaired surplus; but permits such aggregate investment to exceed five percent of capital only if the bank is adequately capitalized and the higher amount will pose no significant risk of loss to the affected deposit insurance fund.

Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 to extend from June 30, 1992, through October 31, 1992, the 75 percent applicable percentage transition rule with respect to separate capitalization of savings association's subsidiaries.

Binds any receiver, conservator, or other acquirer of the selling institution, where the FDIC has waived such right, to any terms of such an agreement that restrict solicitation of a credit card customer of the selling institution, or the use of a credit card customer list. States that the binding effect of such terms, however, does not: (1) restrict the acquirer's authority to offer any product or service to any person identified without using such a customer list; (2) require the acquirer to restrict any pre-existing relationship between the acquirer and a customer; or (3) apply to any transaction in which the acquirer acquires only insured deposits.

Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to state that, for any tort action brought by the RTC in its capacity as conservator or receiver of a failed savings association, the applicable statute of limitations shall be the longer of: (1) the five-year period beginning on the date the claim accrues; or (2) the period applicable under State law. Terminates this provision upon termination of the RTC. Grants the FDIC, as successor to the RTC, the right to pursue any tort action that was properly brought before the RTC before its termination. Amends the Federal Reserve Act, with respect to aggregate limits on insider lending by member banks of the Federal Reserve System, to exclude from the meaning of \"extension of credit\" to all executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders any extension of credit fully secured by U.S. obligations or federally guaranteed obligations. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to prohibit Federal banking agencies from prescribing standards or regulations that set a specific level or range of compensation for officers, directors, or employees of insured depository institutions. Amends the Truth in Savings Act to establish a schedule of renewal notices to depositors for time deposits with different maturity periods over or under two years where the deposits are renewable at maturity without notice from the depositor. Declares that it is the sense of the Senate that the Congress needs to act immediately to forestall a possible railroad strike set to occur at midnight July 1, 1992, since the economic ramifications of such a strike are devastating to the country, and congressional action could prevent that economic damage. Sets a moratorium, from the date of enactment through the ensuing 15 months, during which no Federal savings association may establish or acquire a branch outside the State in which the association has its home office, unless such establishment or acquisition would have been permitted by law before April 9, 1992. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to report to the Congress, and update periodically, detailed information on each of the sites on the National Priorities List established under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA).

Directs the chief executive officer of the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) to study and report to the Congress on: (1) the RTC's efforts to standardize its disposition methods; (2) its success in marketing its commercial mortgage loan-backed securities; (3) the impact of its programs on the commercial real estate mortgage loan secondary market; and (4) the impact of its commercial real estate loan securitization program generally.  \n    Subtitle\n    D\n     - \n    Asset Conservation and Deposit Insurance Protection Act of 1992\n    Asset Conservation and Deposit Insurance Protection Act of 1992 - Amends CERCLA to limit to the actual benefit conferred by a removal, remedial, or other response action undertaken by another party the liability of an insured depository institution or other lender for the actual or threatened release of petroleum or hazardous substances in connection with property acquired by foreclosure, held in a fiduciary capacity, held by a lessor under the terms of an extension of credit, or subject to financial control or oversight under such terms. Shields an insured depository institution or other lender from liability for such hazards if liability were based solely on: (1) certain security interests; (2) unexercised capacity to influence operations at or on property in which there were security interests; (3) terms, covenants, warranties of an extension of credit relating to compliance with environmental laws; (4) certain actions taken with respect to the property or enforcement of terms of the extension of credit; or (5) certain other actions taken with respect to terms of an extension of credit, including exercise or the declining to exercise of remedies for breach of such terms. Declares, however, that a depository institution or lender that causes or significantly and materially contributes to the release of petroleum or a hazardous substance may be liable for removal, remedial, or other response action pertaining to that release. Requires the FDIC to promulgate regulations to require insured depository institutions and other lenders to develop and implement procedures to evaluate environmental risks that may arise from property before making an extension of credit involving a security interest in the property.

Extends such liability limitation to certain subsequent first purchasers of such property. Exempts: (1) such property from any liens for damages associated with actual or threatened petroleum or hazardous substance release; and (2) Federal banking or lending agencies from any law requiring them to grant covenants warranting past or future remediation actions. Declares that a Federal banking or lending agency that causes or significantly and materially contributes to the release of petroleum or a hazardous substance may be liable for removal, remedial, or other response action pertaining to that release.  \n    Subtitle\n    E\n     - \n    Limitations on Liability\n    Declares that, from the enactment of this Act through December 19, 1992, no member of the board of directors of an insured depository institution shall be liable to the institution's shareholders or creditors for acquiescing in or consenting in good faith to: (1) appointment of the RTC or the FDIC as conservator or receiver for that institution; or (2) the acquisition of the institution by a depository institution holding company, or its combination with another insured depository institution, if the appropriate Federal banking agency has requested the institution to be acquired or to combine, and has notified it of grounds for appointing a conservator or receiver. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to state that a member bank of the Federal Reserve System shall not be required to repay any deposit made at a foreign branch of the bank if the branch cannot repay the deposit due to an act of war, insurrection, or civil strife, or an action by a foreign government or instrumentality (whether de jure or de facto) in the country in which the branch is located, unless the member bank has expressly agreed in writing to repay the deposit under those circumstances. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to apply the same bank liability limitation to nonmember insured banks. Declares that claims existing before enactment of this Act shall not be affected by this provision.
