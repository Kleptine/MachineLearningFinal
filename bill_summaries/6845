Permits the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) (Secretary for purposes of this section), for mortgages either in default or facing imminent default, to: (1) authorize the modification of such mortgages; and (2) establish a program for payment of a partial claim to a mortgagee who agrees to apply the claim amount to payment of a mortgage on a 1- to 4-family residence.

Grants the Secretary authority, upon mortgagee request, to establish a program for assignment to HUD of a guaranteed mortgage on a 1- to 4-family residence in or facing imminent default. Prescribes procedures for HUD payment of guarantee, disposition, and loan servicing.

Shields from liability to any party owed a specified duty (as under existing law) a servicer who is deemed to be acting in the best interests of all investors and other parties.

Prohibits a mortgagor from having a net worth exceeding $1 million as of the date of applying for mortgage insurance.
