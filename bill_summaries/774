Prohibits a high-cost mortgage from containing a scheduled payment that is more than twice as large (balloon payment) as the average of earlier scheduled payments.  \n    Section\n    303\n     - \n    \n    Prescribes additional requirements for certain mortgages.

Prohibits a creditor from charging a consumer any fee to modify, renew, extend, or amend a high-cost mortgage, or to defer any payment due under the terms of such mortgage, unless the modification, renewal, extension, or amendment results in a lower annual percentage rate on the mortgage for the consumer, and then only if the amount of the fee is comparable to fees imposed for similar consumer credit transactions secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. Prohibits the charging of any fee, except a processing fee, for payoff statements. Requires a creditor, as a prerequisite to extending consumer credit under a high-cost mortgage, to receive certification from a HUD-approved counselor that the consumer has received counseling on the advisability of the mortgage. Prohibits any creditor from knowingly or intentionally engaging in the unfair act or practice of flipping in connection with a high-cost mortgage. Defines flipping as the making of a loan or extension of credit in the form a high-cost mortgage to a consumer which refinances an existing mortgage when the new loan or extension of credit does not have reasonable, net tangible benefit to the consumer considering all of the circumstances. Prescribes a procedure by which a high cost loan creditor or assignee that, acting in good faith, commits an unintentional violation of these prohibitions and other requirements may make timely corrections and avoid liability for the violation.  \n    Title\n    IV\n     - \n    Office of Housing Counseling\n    Expand and Preserve Home Ownership Through Counseling Act - \n    Section\n    402\n     - \n    \n    Amends the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act to establish within HUD the Office of Housing Counseling, whose Director shall have primary responsibility within HUD for all activities and matters relating to both homeownership and rental housing counseling.  \n    Section\n    403\n     - \n    \n    Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 to require the Secretary to: (1) prescribe counseling procedures for homeownership and rental counseling; and (2) provide for certification of computer software programs for consumers to evaluate different residential mortgage loan proposals.
