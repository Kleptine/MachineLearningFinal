"10/8/2002--Passed House amended. Reaffirms: (1) the language of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, including the phrase \"one Nation under God\"; and (2) the national motto \"In God we trust.\" Modifies the manner in which the Pledge is to be delivered by stating that, when not in uniform, men should remove any non-religious headdress (currently, any headdress)."
