"6/9/1993--Passed House amended. Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 - Amends Federal marine safety law to revise certain definitions regarding passengers, passenger vessels, and certain other types of vessels (including offshore supply, sailing school, and submersible vessels). Authorizes the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating to exempt certain excursion, oceanographic research, and other vessels carrying passengers from certain marine safety laws. Authorizes the Secretary to establish different operating and equipment requirements for such vessels. Requires the Secretary to issue regulations for uninspected passenger vessels: (1) requiring certain additional equipment (including liferafts or other lifesaving equipment) and construction standards; or (2) specifying additional operating standards. Authorizes the Secretary to extend for one year (renewable for another year) the time period for small passenger vessels and passenger vessels chartered with no crew provided to comply with such marine safety requirements, if the owner of such a vessel can demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with such requirements. Expresses the sense of the Congress that operators of passenger vessels should use only U.S.-made vessels."
