Provides exceptions from deployment requirements with respect to: (1) special operations forces; and (2) units needed to assist in the redeployment of members from Iraq to another operational requirement or back to their home stations. Authorizes the: (1) President to waive deployment requirements if the President certifies to Congress within 30 days that the deployment is necessary to meet U.S. national security interests; and (2) chief of staff of the military department concerned to waive such requirements with respect to a member who has voluntarily requested mobilization."
