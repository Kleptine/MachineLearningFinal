Requires the FCC to develop an integrated national database, accessible by the public, that identifies, for each licensee, the spectrum assigned to the licensee and the geographic area to which the spectrum is assigned or licensed.  \n    Section\n    1404\n     - \n    \n    Requires the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, every five years, to conduct a band-by-band analysis of the spectrum managed by each such agency and report to Congress any bands identified as not being used in an effective or efficient way.  \n    Section\n    1405\n     - \n    \n    Requires the FCC, by rule, to reconfigure the band plans for the upper 700 megahertz band and for the unauctioned portions of the lower 700 megahertz band so as to designate up to six megahertz of recovered analog spectrum for small geographic license areas. Prohibits the FCC from any reconfiguration of those band plans if that reconfiguration is determined to be likely to delay the auction of recovered spectrum or the termination of analog licenses required by specified provisions of law."
