Requires that: (1) all STP projects be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with applicable State requirements; and (2) the design and construction standards adopted by States for projects on principal arterials be those approved by the Secretary in cooperation with State highway departments and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. Authorizes any State to request that the Secretary no longer review and approve design and construction standards for any project other than a project on an interstate highway or other multi-lane access control highways. Directs the Secretary, after receiving any such request, to undertake project review only as requested by the State, provided that such State complies with the requirements of all other applicable Federal laws and regulations. Authorizes a State highway or transportation department to establish maintenance standards for projects constructed pursuant to Federal highway provisions, subject to annual approval by the Secretary (which may not be withheld if a State is meeting its own standards for routine maintenance). Requires such department to establish the occupancy requirements of vehicles operating in HOV lanes, but requires no fewer than two occupants for such lanes. Specifies that, for purposes of this Act, motorcycles and bicycles shall not be considered SOVs and that nothing in this Act alters the requirement that each State allow the operation of motorcycles in HOV lanes unless the State certifies that such operation would create a safety hazard. Requires a State to repay all Federal funds for preliminary engineering for any project that has not advanced to construction or acquisition of right-of-way within ten years of receipt of such funds. Specifies that projects that affect historic and scenic values may be designed to protect such values. Requires States that do not adopt laws mandating the use of safety belts and motorcycle helmets to set aside a portion of funds received under the STP for highway safety programs (1.5 percent for noncompliance in FY 1994 and three percent thereafter). Authorizes the Secretary to make grants for safety education, training, monitoring, and enforcement to States that adopt safety belt and helmet laws. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of restrained and unrestrained individuals injured in motor vehicle crashes and of helmetted and non-helmetted motorcyclists injured in motorcycle crashes, collecting and analyzing data from regional trauma systems regarding differences in: (1) the severity of injuries; and (2) acute, rehabilitative, and long-term costs; and (3) mortality and morbidity outcomes. Makes $5,000,000 available to carry out provisions regarding safety belt and motorcycle helmet use. Requires the Secretary to report the results of such study to the Congress within 40 months. Allows a State to use as a credit toward meeting non-Federal matching requirements non-Federal capital expenditures on facilities that serve interstate commerce, provided such State maintains its aggregate non-Federal transportation capital spending at a level at or above the average of such spending for the preceding three fiscal years. Specifies that use of such credit shall not expose public, quasi-public, or private agencies from which the credit is calculated to any additional Federal oversight, regulation, or liability. Increases the period within which construction must be commenced on a right-of-way funded from the right-of-way revolving fund from ten to 20 years. Authorizes Federal reimbursement of a State for costs to acquire rights-of-way in advance of Federal approval or authorization and land necessary to preserve environmental and scenic values if specified conditions are met. Eliminates the requirement that right-of-way revolving fund advances be for projects on the Federal-aid system. Directs the Secretary to submit to the Congress a study of alternative transportation modes for use in the National Park System, considering economic and technical feasibility, environmental effects, projected costs and benefits, general suitability of transportation modes, and methods to obtain private capital for construction. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Secretary to revise the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices to include a standard for a minimum level of retroreflectivity that must be maintained for pavement markings and signs and a standard to define the functional classification of roads that must have a center line, edge lines, or both. Bars the Secretary from making grants under Federal highway provisions to States that fail to provide certification that the asphalt pavement laid in the State in a given year, which was financed in whole or in part by such grants, satisfies the minimum utilization requirement for asphalt rubber pavement (ARP) established by this title. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) modify the minimum utilization requirement for ARP during a phase-in period if the Secretary determines that such a period is necessary to develop production and application facilities for ARP (but limits such period to six years after the enactment of this Act); and (2) increase the minimum utilization requirement for ARP to be used in federally-assisted highway projects to the extent technologically and economically feasible if appropriate to assure markets for the reuse and recycling of scrap tires. Authorizes the Secretary to set aside such provisions for any three-year period based on a determination that there is reliable evidence indicating that manufacture, application, and use of ARP substantially increases risks to human health or the environment as compared to the risks associated with conventional pavement, that ARP cannot be recycled to the same degree as conventional pavement, or that ARP does not perform adequately as a material for the construction or surfacing of highways and roads. Specifies that any such determination may be made for specific States or regions considering climate, geography, and other factors unique to the State or region and that would prevent the adequate performance of ARP in such State or region. Sets the minimum utilization requirement for ARP in federally-assisted highway projects at not less than an average of six pounds of rubber derived from scrap tires for each one ton of finished asphalt pavement used in such projects in the State. Authorizes the Secretary to grant a State credit toward the minimum utilization requirement for volumes of ARP used in other road and construction projects and for ARP containing rubber at rates less than or greater than six pounds per ton, subject to specified requirements. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a minimum utilization requirement for ARP less than the minimum otherwise required in a particular State, upon the request of the State, if the Secretary determines that there is not a sufficient quantity of scrap tires available prior to disposal in the State to meet the minimum utilization requirement and each of the other recycling and processing uses for which scrap tires are required; and (2) conduct a program of research to determine the public health and environmental risks associated with the production and use of ARP, the performance of the ARP under various climate and use conditions, and the degree to which ARP can be recycled. Expands projects eligible for right-of-way revolving fund advances to include passenger rail facilities. Creates a national scenic and historic byways program and an Office of Scenic and Historic Byways within the FHWA. Directs: (1) such Office to provide technical assistance to the State and grants for the planning, design, and development of State scenic byway programs; and (2) the Secretary to establish criteria for roads to be designated as part of an All American Roads program, designate such roads, and establish criteria for the allocation of funds to the States. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary, within two years, to submit to the Congress a proposal for a National Highway System (NHS) to provide an interconnected system of principal arterial routes, to meet national defense requirements, and to serve interstate and interregional travel. Specifies that such NHS shall consist of highways on the IS and other specified urban and rural principal arterials, including toll facilities. Specifies that: (1) during the two-year period prior to the submission of the proposed NHS to the Congress, the interim NHS shall consist of the IS and such urban and rural principal arterials, including toll facilities, as designated by each State; (2) each State shall expend at least 17.5 percent of amounts authorized under this Act for each of FY 1992 and 1993 on such interim NHS; (3) a final NHS submitted to the Congress by the Secretary shall be designated in accordance with guidelines issued to the Congress by the Secretary which provide for equitable allocation of mileage among the States; and (4) if a State certifies to the Secretary that apportionments required to be spent on the NHS are in excess of amounts needed to adequately maintain the NHS routes within the State as determined by the bridge and pavement management systems, the State may transfer up to 20 percent of such amounts for any projects eligible under the STP. Directs the States and U.S. territories to complete a functional reclassification, to be updated periodically, of all public roads by September 30, 1993.
