"10/26/1990--Conference report filed in House. \n    Title\n    I\n     - \n    Provisions for Attainment and Maintenance of National Ambient Air Quality Standards\n    Amends the Clean Air Act to require State Governors to designate areas within a State as nonattainment, attainment, or unclassifiable, with regard to air quality standards, and to submit such designations to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) no later than one year after the promulgation of a new or revised air quality standard. Authorizes the Administrator to modify such designations, as necessary. Designates areas currently required to be listed under the Clean Air Act as nonattainment, attainment, or unclassifiable areas, as specified. Provides for the redesignation of areas, as appropriate. Prohibits the redesignation of any area from nonattainment to unclassifiable. Revises the boundaries of Serious, Severe, or Extreme ozone or carbon monoxide nonattainment areas located in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) or consolidated metropolitan statistical areas (CMSAs) to include the entire MSA or CMSA unless the State Governor notifies the Administrator that additional time is necessary to evaluate such revision. Excludes areas within the MSA or CMSA that do not contribute to violation of the air quality standard, subject to the Administrator's approval. Designates: (1) areas identified (in 52 Federal Register 29383) as Group I areas as particulate matter 10 (PM-10) nonattainment areas; (2) areas containing sites for which air quality monitoring data show a violation of national air quality standards for PM-10 before 1989 as PM-10 nonattainment areas; and (3) areas not meeting either description as PM-10 unclassifiable areas. Authorizes the Administrator to require States to designate areas with respect to the national air quality standard for lead. Revises provisions concerning State implementation plan requirements. Sets forth provisions for plan approval and revision. Requires plans to provide for attainment of national air quality standards in nonattainment areas within three years of this Act's enactment or within five years of a finding of substantial inadequacy. Retains a moratorium on construction or modification of major stationary sources in certain areas until such areas meet applicable requirements concerning permit programs or attainment standards for sulfur dioxide. Repeals provisions concerning: (1) extensions of time for attainment dates; (2) requirements concerning parking surcharges and transportation regulations; and (3) suspensions of certain plan requirements. Requires the Administrator to publish a triennial (currently, annual) document which sets forth applicable requirements of the implementation plan for each State. Directs States to submit implementation plans within three years, or such shorter period as the Administrator prescribes (currently, nine months), of the promulgation of an air quality standard. Sets forth plan conformity requirements. Requires Federal transportation programs to implement transportation provisions of implementation plans. Prohibits Federal agencies from funding or approving any transportation program unless it conforms to an implementation plan in effect under this Act.

Authorizes the issuance of a permit to construct or operate a new source if demonstrated that the benefits of such source significantly outweigh environmental and social costs. Prohibits the use of existing growth allowances in areas which are notified that implementation plans containing such allowances are substantially inadequate. Allows new or modified major stationary sources to comply with any offset requirement for increased air pollutant emissions with reductions of the pollutant from such sources or from other sources in the same nonattainment area. Permits the sources to obtain reductions in another nonattainment area if the other area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification and emissions from the other area contribute to violations of air quality standards in the area in which the sources are located. Requires such reductions to be in effect by the time such sources commence operation and to assure that the total tonnage of increased emissions is offset by an equal or greater reduction in the actual emissions from the same or other area sources. Provides that incidental emissions reductions not required by this Act shall be creditable if such reductions meet offset requirements. Authorizes sources to offset by alternative or innovative means emissions increases from rocket engine and motor firing under specified conditions. Requires States containing ozone, carbon monoxide, or PM-10 nonattainment areas, together with local officials of such areas, to review and update, as necessary, planning procedures for such areas.

Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress and the President on any agreement with the Department of Transportation entered into prior to this Act's enactment that provides for an analysis of the health and environmental aspects of magnetic levitation technology. Requires the Administrator to: (1) promulgate regulations requiring all affected sources subject to title V to monitor carbon monoxide emissions in accordance with such title; and (2) make such emissions data available to the public. Authorizes appropriations for specified grants for air quality planning.  \n    Title\n    IX\n     - \n    Clean Air Research\n    Directs the Administrator to: (1) conduct research, testing, and development of methods for sampling, measurement, monitoring, analysis, and modeling of air pollutants; (2) conduct research on the short- and long-term effects of air pollutants on human health; (3) conduct research to improve the understanding of the causes, effects, and trends of ecosystem damage from air pollutants; (4) oversee an experimental research effort to be carried out at the Liquefied Gaseous Fuels Spill Test Facility; and (5) conduct an engineering research and technology program to develop and demonstrate nonregulatory air pollution prevention strategies and technologies. Authorizes the Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to conduct: (1) research on risks to human health from air pollutants; and (2) a program for the education and training of physicians in environmental health. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Administrator to implement a plan for identifying areas in which such activities can be carried out in conjunction with other Federal ecological and air pollution research efforts. Continues the acid precipitation research program set forth in the Acid Precipitation Act of 1980. Sets forth the responsibilities of the Acid Precipitation Task Force. Authorizes the Administrator, if an air pollution problem of significance may result from a discharge into the atmosphere, to call a conference concerning such problem in or near one of the places such discharge will or may occur. Requires the Administrator to conduct a research program to predict air emissions and other environmental effects related to the use of clean alternative fuels to determine the risks and benefits to health and the environment relative to those from gasoline and diesel fuels. Directs the Administrator to study and report to the Congress on whether air pollution control technologies in selected industrialized countries have beneficial applications to U.S. air pollution control efforts. Requires the Administrator to: (1) establish a program to research the effects of acid deposition on waters where acid deposition has been most acute; and (2) enter into a research contract with a university that has a field laboratory on a body of water between 25,000 and 75,000 acres which lies within a Biosphere Reserve, as designated by the Department of State. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Administrator to sponsor monitoring and research and report annually to the Congress on the occurrence and effects of: (1) acid deposition on surface waters west of the Mississippi River; (2) acid deposition on high elevation ecosystems; and (3) episodic acidification, particularly with respect to high elevation watersheds. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy, in carrying out research at the Liquefied Gaseous Fuels Spill Test Facility, to enter into contracts with, and make grants to, nonprofit entities affiliated with the University of Nevada and the University of Wyoming. Authorizes appropriations.  \n    Title\n    X\n     - \n    Disadvantaged Business Concerns\n    Requires at least ten percent of Federal funding for research under this Act to be made available to disadvantaged business concerns. Deems the following institutions to be disadvantaged business concerns: (1) historically black colleges and universities and colleges and universities in which 40 percent of the students are Hispanic; (2) minority institutions (as defined by the General Education Provision Act); and (3) private and voluntary organizations controlled by individuals who are socially and economically disadvantaged.  \n    Title\n    XI\n     - \n    Clean Air Employment Transition Assistance\n    Amends the Job Training Partnership Act to authorize the Secretary of Labor to make grants to States, substate grantees, employers, employer associations, and representatives of employees to provide training, adjustment assistance, employment services, and needs-related payments to eligible individuals adversely affected by compliance with the Clean Air Act. Authorizes adjustment assistance grants to be used for job research and relocation allowances. Requires job search allowances to reimburse an individual for up to 90 percent of the cost of job search expenses. Limits such reimbursement to $800 unless a greater reimbursement is approved by the Secretary. Sets forth criteria for granting job search allowances. Permits eligible individuals to be granted relocation allowances if they: (1) cannot reasonably be expected to secure suitable employment in the commuting area in which they reside; (2) have obtained suitable employment affording an expectation of long-term duration in the area in which they wish to relocate or have obtained bona fide offers of employment; and (3) are totally separated from employment at the time relocation commences. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations with respect to the use of grants for needs-related payments to enable eligible individuals to complete training or education programs. Requires such regulations to: (1) provide for payments only to individuals who have ceased to qualify for unemployment compensation, have enrolled in training within a specified time period, and are participating in training and education programs; (2) provide that such individuals receive a total family income below the lower living standard income level; (3) provide that such payments are equal to the higher of the applicable level of unemployment compensation or the poverty level; (4) provide for the adjustment of payments to reflect changes in total family income; and (5) provide that the grantee obtain information with respect to such income and changes in such income from such individuals. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Comptroller General to assess and report to the Congress on the effects on employment attributable to compliance with this Act."
