"5/13/2004--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to make permanent the increased upper limit amounts for the ten percent income tax rate bracket for individual taxpayers ($14,000 for married taxpayers filing joint tax returns and surviving spouses, $10,000 for heads of household, and $7,000 for unmarried individuals and married individuals filing separately). Allows an inflation adjustment to such amounts for married taxpayers filing joint tax returns, surviving spouses, and heads of household for taxable years beginning after 2003 based on the difference from the Consumer Price Index for 2002."
