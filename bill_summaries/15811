Requires the Administrator to certify to Congress, at least 15 days in advance of any cooperative agreement with the People's Republic of China, or any company incorporated under Chinese laws, involving spacecraft, spacecraft systems, launch systems, or scientific or technical information, that such agreement is not detrimental to the U.S. space launch industry and will not improve China's missile or space launch capabilities. Directs the NASA Inspector General to conduct an annual audit of NASA policies and procedures for the export of technologies and the transfer of scientific and technical information to assess the extent to which NASA is carrying out its activities in compliance with Federal export control laws and such certification.  \n    Section\n    127\n     - \n    \n    Prohibits the obligation of any funds authorized by this Act for the definition, design, procurement, or development of an inflatable space structure to replace any International Space Station components scheduled for launch in the Assembly Sequence adopted by NASA in June 1999. Provides that nothing shall preclude NASA from leasing or otherwise using a commercially provided inflatable habitation module if such module would: (1) cost the same or less than the remaining cost of completing and attaching the baseline habitation module; (2) impose no delays to the Assembly Sequence; and (3) result in no increased safety risk. Directs NASA to report to Congress on substituting any inflatable habitation module or other inflatable structures for one of the elements included in such Assembly Sequence.  \n    Section\n    128\n     - \n    \n    Prohibits any funds authorized by this Act from being used to create a Government-owned corporation to perform the functions that are the subject of the Consolidated Space Operations Contract.   \n    Title\n    II\n     - \n    International Space Station\n    Directs the Administrator to report bimonthly, until October 1, 2006, on whether or not the Russians have performed work expected of them and necessary to complete the International Space Station. Directs the President to notify Congress of the decision on whether or not to proceed with permanent replacement of the Russian Service Module, other Russian elements in the critical path of the Space Station, or Russian launch services. Requires the United States to seek assurances from the Russian Government that it places a higher priority on fulfilling its commitments to the Space Station than it places on extending the life of the Mir Space Station. Declares that the Administrator, if any international partner in the Space Station Program willfully violates any commitments or agreements for the provision of Space Station-related hardware or related goods or services, should seek a commensurate reduction in such partner's utilization rights until such commitments or agreements have been fulfilled. Directs the Administrator to seek to reduce NASA's share of Space Station common operating costs. \n    Section\n    202\n     - \n    \n    Limits (excluding funding and costs of the Station and space shuttle launch with respect to operations, research, or crew return activities subsequent to substantial completion of the Space Station, missions on which at least 75 percent of the shuttle payload by mass is devoted to research, and space shuttle safety and reliability) the total amount that may be appropriated for: (1) costs of the Space Station; and (2) space shuttle launch costs in connection with Space Station assembly. Provides for increases attributable to: (1) the lack of performance or the termination of participation of any of the participating countries; (2) loss or failure of a U.S.-provided element during launch or on-orbit; (3) on-orbit assembly problems; (4) new technologies or training to improve safety; and (5) the need to launch a space shuttle to ensure safety of the crew or maintain Station integrity. Requires the Administrator to provide written notices of such increases to specified congressional committees. Requires the Administrator, as part of the annual Shuttle program and Station budget request, to identify the costs for assembly and development of the Space Station and for shuttle research missions to which cost limitations do not apply.  \n    Section\n    203\n     - \n    \n    Directs the Administrator to contract with the National Research Council and the National Academy of Public Administration to conduct a study of the status of life and microgravity research as it relates to the Space Station.  \n    Section\n    204\n     - \n    \n    Amends the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000 to require the Space Station commercial development demonstration program to apply to commercial use agreements entered into prior to Space Station completion or the end of FY 2002 (currently, FY 2004), whichever is earlier.  \n    Section\n    205\n     - \n    \n    Directs the Administrator to enter into an agreement with a non-Government organization to conduct Space Station research utilization and commercialization management activities subsequent to substantial completion.
