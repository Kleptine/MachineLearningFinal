Requires the President (current law authorizes the United States), in the event of a maritime disaster discharge, to act through an emergency strike force to coordinate and direct all efforts to eliminate the threat posed by such discharge and to ensure compliance with contingency plans. Makes technical amendments to provisions concerning such discharges and requirements of the National Contingency Plan. Authorizes the reimbursement from the Fund of persons required to participate in removal efforts.
