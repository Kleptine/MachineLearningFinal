"3/20/1997--Passed Senate amended. Urges the President to examine, with leaders of governments of other countries in the Western Hemisphere, the effectiveness of efforts to improve counterdrug activities in order to curtail the production, traffic, and abuse of illicit drugs and to define plans for specific actions to improve cooperation on such activities. Expresses the sense of the Congress that there has been ineffective and insufficient progress in halting the production in, and transit through Mexico of, illegal drugs. Requires the President, by September 1, 1997, to submit a report to the Congress describing the extent of any significant and demonstrable progress made by: (1) the Governments of the United States and Mexico between March 1, 1997, and the date of the report in achieving specified objectives relating to counterdrug cooperation, such as the investigation and dismantlement of the principal organizations responsible for drug trafficking and related crimes in both countries; (2) the U.S. Government during such period in implementing a comprehensive antidrug education effort in the United States targeted at reversing the rise in drug use by America's youth and a comprehensive international drug interdiction and enforcement strategy; and (3) the U.S. Government in deploying 1,000 additional active-duty, full-time patrol agents within the Immigration and Naturalization Service in FY 1997."
