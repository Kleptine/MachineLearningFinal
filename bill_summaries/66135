Repeals the reduction from two-thirds to 51 percent of the minimum number of full-time teachers employed in a school necessary to endorse a petition to convert a District public school or an existing private or independent school into a public charter school. Repeals the grant to a teacher employed at a D.C. Public school that converts to a public charter school of the option to remain at the charter school during the school's first year of operation after receiving an extended leave of absence, and thereafter at the charter school's sole discretion. Modifies the requirement that the Mayor and the D.C. government give a right of first offer with respect to any facility or property not previously (or under contract to be) disposed of to an eligible applicant whose petition to establish a public charter school is conditionally approved. Repeals the mandatory annual reinstatement of such right. Extends the restriction on the exercise of such right with respect to certain facilities or properties to exclude any facility or property that is: (1) the subject of a previously proposed resolution submitted to the D.C. Council by the Mayor on or before December 1, 2004, seeking authority for disposition of such facility or property; or (2) under an Exclusive Rights Agreement executed on or before such date. Modifies the terms of purchase or lease of such a facility or property to require the Mayor to negotiate in accordance with written rules or regulations as determined by the Mayor, and published in the District of Columbia Register.

Council, the appropriate congressional committees, and the CFO. Grants such Board the authority to solicit, award, and execute contracts independently of the Office of Contracting and Procurement and the Chief Procurement Officer.
