"1/23/1991--Passed House amended. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to declare that any individual who performed Desert Shield services (and the individual's spouse) shall be entitled to the benefit of extending the time for performing certain tax-related acts by reason of service in a combat zone. Allows the payment of interest on any overpayments due such individuals, starting April 15. (Generally, interest will be paid only on refunds made more than 45 days after a return is filed.) Applies the time extension granted by this Act to individuals hospitalized inside as well as outside the United States. Limits the time extension inside the United States to five years of continuous hospitalization; but denies such extension to the individual's spouse."
