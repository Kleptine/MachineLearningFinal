Senate Election Campaign Ethics Act of 1990 - \n    Title\n    I\n     - \n    Senate Election Campaign Spending Limits and Benefits\n    Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to provide for spending limits and to establish eligibility requirements for benefits for Senate primary, general, and runoff elections. Limits personal expenditures during an election cycle to $250,000 and aggregate expenditures for a general election to the lesser of: (1) $5,550,000; or (2) the greater of: (a) $950,000; or (b) $400,000 plus 30 cents for each voter up to 4,000,000 voters and 25 cents for the number of voters exceeding 4,000,000. Limits expenditures for the primary election and any runoff election to, respectively: (1) the lesser of 67 percent of the general election expenditure limit or $2,750,000; and (2) 20 percent of such limit. Provides for increasing threshold amounts under this Act in accordance with increases in the price index. Increases such primary and runoff election spending limits by the aggregate amount of independent expenditures in excess of $10,000 made against, or on behalf of any opponent of, such candidate during the applicable period. Requires an individual who files as a candidate for the primary election, in order to be eligible to receive the benefits for that election, to file a declaration with the Secretary of the Senate indicating that the candidate and his or her authorized committees will comply with such limits. Sets forth a threshold contribution requirement for general election candidates that is met if the candidate and the candidate's authorized committees have received contributions during the applicable period in an amount at least equal to ten percent of the general election expenditure limit. Disallows, for purposes of satisfying such requirement, contributions by: (1) an individual pursuant to a written instrument which does not identify such individual as the contributor; (2) an intermediary or conduit; or (3) an individual during the applicable period which exceed $250; and (4) an individual residing outside the candidate's State which exceed 50 percent of the aggregate allowable contributions received by the candidate during the applicable period. Requires a candidate for the general election, in order to be eligible to receive the benefits for that election, to file a certification with Secretary of the Senate that: (1) the candidate and his or her authorized committees comply with the primary and runoff election expenditure limits and the threshold contribution requirement; (2) they will abide by additional spending and contribution limits and other requirements set forth by this Act; and (3) at least one other candidate has qualified for the same general election ballot under the law of the State involved. Establishes spending limitations for a candidate in a State with no more than one transmitter for a commercial VHF television station. Allows a candidate or Federal officeholder to establish a fund with amounts subject to the requirements of this Act up to a certain amount to defray the costs of legal and accounting services provided to ensure compliance with this Act or in connection with the candidate's activities as a Federal officeholder other than costs for the purpose of influencing the election of such candidate to Federal office. Permits the candidate to petition the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for a waiver of such limitation if such costs exceed the limitation. Requires, upon termination of the fund, that remaining amounts be transferred to: (1) another fund to be used for such purposes during the next general election; (2) an authorized committee of the candidate as contributions allocable to the next such election; or (3) the Senate Election Campaign Fund. Exempts any expenditure by the candidate or the candidate's authorized committees for Federal, State, or local taxes on earnings allocable to contributions from the general expenditure limit.

Entitles candidates to certain broadcast media rates and mailing rates and to voter communication vouchers to purchase broadcast time during the general election period. Provides for additional payments and suspension of spending limits in cases where non-participating candidates exceed spending limitations. Permits candidates to use such payments to defray expenditures in the general election. Prohibits the use of such payments to: (1) make any payments directly or indirectly to the candidate or the candidate's immediate family, except to repay any loan used to further the general election of such candidate; (2) make any expenditure other than expenditures to further the general election; (3) make any expenditures in violation of State or Federal law; or (4) repay any loan except to the extent the proceeds of such loan were used to further the general election. Requires the FEC to certify the eligibility of candidates to the Secretary of the Treasury in order for such candidates to receive benefits.

Declares that if any of such provisions are held to be invalid, all provisions of this Act shall be treated as invalid. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to: (1) revise the definition of a \"political committee\" to delete references to any separate segregated fund and any committee, club, association, or group which receives contributions or makes expenditures annually totaling over $1,000 and to include any national, State, or district committee of a political party, including any subordinate committee thereof; (2) repeal provisions excluding nonpartisan registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns and the establishment of, and solicitation of contributions for, a separate segregated fund from the definition of a \"contribution or expenditure\" by a national bank, corporation, or labor organization; (3) prohibit making, soliciting, or receiving contributions or making expenditures to influence a Federal election by any person other than an individual or a political committee; and (4) deem any political committee which is established, financed, maintained or controlled by any candidate or Federal officeholder to be an authorized committee of such candidate or officeholder for purposes of limitations on contributions to a candidate's committees.
