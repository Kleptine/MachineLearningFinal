"11/27/1991--Conference report filed in House. Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1991 - \n    Title\n    I\n     - \n    Death Penalty\n    Federal Death Penalty Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criteria for the imposition of the death penalty for Federal crimes. Requires the Government, for any offense punishable by death, to serve notice upon the defendant a reasonable time before trial or acceptance of a plea, of its intention to seek the death penalty and of the aggravating factors upon which it will rely. Requires a separate sentencing hearing before a jury, or the court upon motion by the defendant, when the defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to an offense punishable by death. Allows the defendant and the Government to present any information relevant to sentencing, without regard to the rules of evidence, but permits information to be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. Specifies mitigating factors which the defendant must establish by a preponderance of the information and aggravating factors which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Includes as threshold aggravating factors for homicide that the defendant: (1) intentionally killed the victim; (2) intentionally inflicted serious bodily injury which resulted in the death of the victim; (3) intentionally participated in an act, contemplating that the life of a person would be taken, and the victim died as a direct result of the act; (4) attempted to kill the President of the United States; or (5) intentionally engaged in an act constituting reckless disregard for human life, knowing that the act created a grave risk of death of someone other than the participants, and the victim died as a direct result of the act. Sets forth special aggravating factors with respect to the crimes of treason, espionage, homicide, and attempted murder of the President. States that no person who was less than 18 years of age at the time of the offense may be sentenced to death. Prohibits the execution of mentally retarded persons, persons who as a result of mental disability lack the mental capacity to understand the death penalty and why it was imposed on them, or pregnant women. Directs the court, or the jury by unanimous vote, to impose the death penalty upon a finding that such sentence is justified based on consideration of both the aggravating and mitigating factors. Requires the court to instruct the jury not to consider the race, color, national origin, creed, or sex of the defendant or any victim in its consideration of the sentence. Specifies that the jury or the court is never required to impose a death sentence. Establishes procedures for appeal from a death sentence. Requires the Court of Appeals to review the record, address all substantive and procedural issues raised on appeal, and consider whether such sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor and whether the evidence supports the special finding of the existence of the required aggravating factor. Specifies that whenever such court finds that the sentence was imposed under such influence, the admissible evidence adduced does not support such special finding, or the proceedings involved any other legal error requiring reversal of the sentence that was properly preserved for appeal under the rules of criminal procedure, the court shall remand the case for reconsideration or impose a sentence other than death (and, in any other case, remand for reconsideration). Requires the court to provide a written explanation of its determination. Prohibits requiring any employee of any State department of corrections, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Marshals Service, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), or any provider of services under contract to participate in any prosecution or execution if participation is contrary to his or her moral or religious convictions. Bars the imposition of a death sentence for a death-eligible offense committed in Indian country unless the Indian tribe having criminal jurisdiction over land and persons subject to such jurisdiction has elected to have this title apply in such cases. Limits the circumstances under which the offense of delivering defense information to aid foreign governments is punishable by death. Provides for the imposition of the death penalty for: (1) murders committed by prisoners in Federal correctional institutions; (2) kidnappings which result in the death of any person; (3) attempting to kill the President of the United States (if such attempt results in bodily injury or comes dangerously close to causing the President's death); (4) murder in the aid of a racketeering activity; (5) civil rights murders and certain murders involving damage to religious property or obstruction of persons in the free exercise of religious belief; (6) genocide; (7) murders of Federal law enforcement officials; and (8) other specified offenses. Death Penalty for Drug Kingpins Act of 1991 - Provides for imposition of the death penalty for those: (1) subject to mandatory life imprisonment for committing a Federal drug felony as part of a continuing criminal enterprise which involved specified quantities of controlled substances or specified gross receipts arising out of such activity; (2) convicted of committing such a felony as part of a continuing criminal enterprise where the defendant is a principal administrator, organizer, or leader of such an enterprise and, in order to obstruct the investigation or prosecution of the enterprise, attempts or conspires to kill any public officer, juror, witness, or family or household member of such a person; and (3) who, acting with a specified state of mind, engage in a Federal drug felony resulting in the death of another person in the course of the violation or from the use of the controlled substance involved in the violation. Sets forth aggravating factors for drug offense death penalty, including previous conviction of an offense for which a sentence of death or life imprisonment was authorized, previous conviction of other serious offenses, previous serious drug felony conviction, use of a firearm, distribution to persons under age 21, distribution near schools, using minors in trafficking, and lethal adulteration. Drive-By-Shooting Prevention Act of 1991 - Sets penalties for any individual who, in furtherance or to escape detection of a major drug offense, with intent to intimidate, harass, injure, or maim, fires a weapon into a group of two or more people causing: (1) grave risk to human life (a fine and up to 25 years imprisonment); or (2) death (a fine, life imprisonment, or, in the case of first degree murder, a sentence of death). Makes any U.S. national who kills or attempts to kill another U.S. national while outside the United States but within the jurisdiction of another country subject to Federal provisions regarding murder, manslaughter, and attempt to commit murder or manslaughter. Specifies that no prosecution under this provision: (1) may be instituted except upon the written approval of the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, or an Assistant Attorney General; and (2) shall be approved if prosecution has previously been undertaken by a foreign country for the same act or omission, unless the Attorney General determines that the act or omission took place in a country in which the person is no longer present and the country lacks the ability to lawfully secure such person's return. States that a determination by the Attorney General under this provision is not subject to judicial review. Authorizes imposition of the death penalty for: (1) sexual abuse resulting in death; (2) sexual exploitation of children resulting in death; (3) murder by escaped prisoners; (4) gun murders during Federal crimes of violence or drug trafficking crimes; and (5) homicides and attempted homicides involving firearms in Federal facilities.  \n    Title\n    II\n     - \n    Habeas Corpus Reform\n    Habeas Corpus Reform Act of 1991 - Amends the Federal judicial code to revise provisions governing habeas corpus procedures, particularly in capital cases. Establishes a statute of limitations of one year for the filing of an application for habeas corpus relief from a sentence of death. Prescribes periods during which such time requirement shall be tolled, including any period during which the applicant is not represented by counsel. Provides for dismissal of an application for failure to comply with such time requirement, except where the waiver of such requirement is warranted by exceptional circumstances. Specifies requirements for stays of execution in capital cases. Bars the court from applying a new rule representing a sharp break from precedent announced by the U.S. Supreme Court that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time the claimant's sentence became final in State court. Requires a State in which capital punishment may be imposed to provide legal services to indigents: (1) charged with offenses for which capital punishment is sought; (2) who have been sentenced to death and who seek appellate, collateral, or unitary review in State court; and (3) who have been sentenced to death and who seek certiorari review of State court judgments in the U.S. Supreme Court. Directs the State to establish an appointing authority which shall be a statewide defender organization, a resource center, or a committee appointed by the highest State court, comprised of bar members with substantial experience in, or commitment to, criminal justice. Requires the appointing authority to: (1) publish a roster of attorneys qualified to be appointed in capital cases, procedures by which attorneys are appointed, and standards governing qualifications and performance of counsel (including knowledge and understanding of pertinent legal authorities regarding issues in capital cases; skills in the conduct of negotiations, litigation, and investigation of capital cases, the psychiatric history and current condition of capital clients, and the preparation and writing of legal papers in capital cases; in the case of counsel appointed for the trial or sentencing stages, five years of experience as a prosecutor or defense counsel in criminal felony cases; and, in the case of counsel for the appellate, post-conviction, or unitary review stages, three years of such experience); (2) monitor the performance of attorneys appointed and delete from the roster any attorney who fails to meet qualification and performance standards; and (3) appoint a defense team, including at least two attorneys, to represent a client at the relevant stage of proceedings, promptly upon receiving notice of the need for the appointment from the relevant State court. Sets forth additional provisions with respect to the appointment of counsel. Requires that, in the case of an applicant for Federal habeas corpus relief under sentence of death, a claim presented in a second or successive application be dismissed unless the applicant shows that: (1) the basis of the claim could not have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence before the applicant filed the prior application, or the failure to raise the claim in the prior application was due to action by State officials in violation of the U.S. Constitution; and (2) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient, if proven, to undermine the court's confidence in the applicant's guilt of the offense for which the capital sentence was imposed, or in the validity of that sentence under Federal law. Grants an applicant under sentence of death the right to appeal without a certification of probable cause, except after denial of a second or successive application. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Omnibus Act) to require the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) to provide grants to the States to support litigation pertaining to Federal habeas corpus petitions in capital cases. Specifies that the total funding available for such grants within a fiscal year shall be equal to the funding provided to capital resource centers, pursuant to Federal appropriations, in the same fiscal year.  \n    Title\n    III\n     - \n    Exclusionary Rule\n    Amends the Federal criminal code to bar the exclusion of evidence obtained as a result of a search or seizure that was in violation of the fourth amendment to the Constitution if the search or seizure was carried out in reasonable reliance on a warrant that was issued by a detached and neutral magistrate and that was ultimately found to be invalid unless: (1) the judicial officer in issuing the warrant was materially misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false or would have known was false except for his reckless disregard of the truth; (2) the judicial officer provided approval of the warrant without exercising a neutral and detached review of the application for the warrant; (3) the warrant was based on an affidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable; or (4) the warrant is so facially deficient that the executing officers could not reasonably presume it to be valid.  \n    Title\n    IV\n     - \n    Coerced Confessions\n    Specifies that the admission into evidence of a coerced confession (i.e., one elicited in violation of the fifth or fourteenth amendments to the Constitution) shall not be considered harmless error.  \n    Title\n    V\n     - \n    Firearms\n    \n    Subtitle\n    A\n     - \n    Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act\n    Specifies that, beginning 90 days after the enactment of this subtitle and ending on the day before the date that the Attorney General certifies that the national instant criminal background check system (System) is established (pursuant to this subtitle), it shall be unlawful for any licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer to sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun to an unlicensed individual unless: (1) after the most recent proposal of such transfer by the individual, the transferor has received a statement of eligibility from the individual, verified the identity of such individual by examining the identification document presented, provided notice of the contents, and transmitted a copy of the statement to the chief law enforcement officer (chief) of the place of residence of the individual within one day after the individual furnishes the statement; and five business days have elapsed from the date the transferor furnished notice of the contents of the statement to the chief, during which period the transferor has not received information from the chief that receipt or possession of the handgun by the individual would be in violation of Federal, State, or local law, or has received notice from the chief that the chief has no information indicating that such receipt or possession would violate Federal, State, or local law; (2) the individual has presented to the transferor a statement from the chief, issued in the past ten days, stating that the individual requires a handgun because of a threat to such individual or such individual's family; (3) the individual has presented to the transferor a permit to possess a handgun that has been issued in the past five years by the State in which the transfer is to take place under a State law which requires law enforcement verification of the individual's legal qualification to possess a handgun; (4) State law requires that an authorized government official verifies that the information available to such official does not indicate that possession of a handgun by the purchaser would be unlawful, with exceptions; (5) the Secretary of the Treasury has approved the transfer under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC); or (6) the Secretary has certified, on application of the transferor, that compliance with the notice requirement is impracticable for specified reasons.
