"9/24/1999--Introduced. Expresses the sense of the Senate that it should: (1) increase the Federal investment in education, including providing increases in support for specified programs; and (2) stay within the discretionary spending caps and avoid using the resources of the social security program by finding discretionary spending offsets that do not jeopardize important investments in other key programs within the jurisdiction of a specified congressional subcommittee."
