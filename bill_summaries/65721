General Provisions: This  \n    Chapter\n    - (Sec. 101) Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, under specified conditions, to use Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds to make such financial emergency financial assistance available to producers on a farm (other than producers of cottonseed or sugar cane) that have incurred qualifying crop or quality losses for the 2003, 2004, or 2005 crop (as elected by a producer), but limited to only one of the crop year listed, due to damaging weather or related condition. Limits qualifying crop losses for 2005 to only those losses caused by a hurricane or tropical storm of the 2004 hurricane season in counties presidentially declared disaster areas. Earmarks funds for crop losses in Virginia, and for fruit and vegetables losses in North Carolina resulting from hurricanes, tropical storms, and other weather related disasters that occurred during calendar year 2003. Disqualifies farm producers for such assistance with respect to losses if the producers\n     - \n    (1) did not obtain a policy or plan of insurance for an insurable commodity under the Federal Crop Insurance Act; (2) did not file the required paperwork and pay the administrative fee by the applicable State filing deadline for a noninsurable commodity under the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996; (3) had adjusted gross incomes greater than $2.50 million in 2003; or (4) were not in compliance with highly erodible land conservation and wetland conservation provisions. Waives such disqualification if the producers enter into a contract with the Secretary agreeing to either: (1) obtain a plan of insurance providing additional coverage for the insurable commodity for each of the next two crops; or (2) file the required paperwork and pay the administrative fee by the applicable State filing deadline for the noninsurable commodity for each of the next two crops. Requires a producer who violates the contract to reimburse the Secretary of the full amount of such assistance received under this Act.

Directs the Secretary to use CCC funds to make and administer payments for livestock losses to producers for 2003 or 2004 (as elected by a producer), but not both, in a county that has received an emergency designation by the President or the Secretary after January 1, 2003. Requires an amount of such assistance determined by the Secretary to be made available for the American Indian livestock program under the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001.

Prohibits budget scoring of any savings from such limitation until FY 2008. (Sec. 102) Requires the Secretary to use $40 million to compensate first processors and producers in 2004 hurricane disaster counties for crop and other weather-related losses, to be calculated and paid on the basis of losses on 40 acre harvesting units, on the same terms and conditions, to the extent practicable, as the payments made under the Agricultural Assistance Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-7). Earmarks specified portions of such funds to make payments to: (1) processors in Florida eligible to obtain a loan under the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996; and (2) Hawaii for assistance to a Hawaiian agricultural transportation cooperative (the members of which are eligible to participate in the Farm Service Agency-administered Commodity Loan Program). (Sec. 103) Requires the Secretary to use $10 million to: (1) make payments to dairy producers for dairy production and spoilage losses in 2004 hurricane disaster counties; and (2) provide assistance to producers and first handlers of the 2004 crop of cottonseed located in such counties. (Sec. 105) Requires the Secretary to use CCC funds (as emergency requirements), facilities, and authorities to carry out Sections 101, 102, 103, 104, 108, 109, 110, and 111 of this chapter. (Sec. 106) Deems the communities in Burlington and Camden Counties in New Jersey, affected by the July 12, 2004, flood, to be rural areas during FY 2005 for purposes of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, and of the direct and guaranteed loan programs under the Housing Act of 1949 and the grant programs under such Act. Makes any limitations under such Acts that are based on the income of families inapplicable during FY 2005 with respect to them or to businesses or families residing in them. (Sec. 107) Requires the Secretary to provide financial and technical assistance to repair, and if necessary, replace Hope Mills Dam, Cumberland County, North Carolina, in accordance with the dam safety standards of the State of North Carolina. Earmarks for this purpose certain funds provided in this chapter for the Emergency Watershed Protection program of the Natural Resources Conservation Service. (Sec. 108) Requires the Secretary to provide $90 million to a specified fund established to encourage exportation and domestic consumption of agricultural products to make payments with respect to 2004 hurricane losses.
