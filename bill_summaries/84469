"7/20/1989--Introduced. Declares that it is the sense of the Senate that: (1) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the crew of Apollo 11, and all associated with the first lunar landing should be congratulated on the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission; (2) the most appropriate celebration of that landing is renewed support of the Senate and the American people for our space program, especially the International Space Station Freedom program (Space Station program); (3) the additional elements of Earth sensing satellites needed to achieve the goals of the \"Mission to Planet Earth\" should be vigorously pursued in a cooperative global effort involving all nations; and (4) the President, the Vice President in his capacity as the Chairman of the National Space Council, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Administrator of NASA, and the appropriate committees of the Congress should together explore actions to provide NASA's FY 1990 budget request for the Space Station program to insure the continued development of the Space Station program and the expeditious development of the global environmental program envisioned as the \"Mission to Planet Earth.\""
