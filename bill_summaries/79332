"5/8/2003--Passed Senate amended. Amends the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) to extend the meaning of \"agent of a foreign power\" to any person, other than a U.S. person, that engages in international terrorism or activities in preparation for them (regardless of whether affiliated with groups engaging in such terrorism or activities), for purposes of securing FISA warrants authorizing the electronic surveillance of communications between and among foreign powers. Requires the Attorney General to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees on: (1) the aggregate number of non-U.S. persons targeted for FISA orders, including a break-down of those targeted for electronic surveillance, physical searches, pen registers, and access to records; (2) the number of individuals covered by a FISA order who were determined to have acted wholly alone in the activities covered by such order; and (3) the number of times that the Attorney General has authorized that information obtained under FISA, or any derivative information, may be used in a criminal proceeding. Requires the Attorney General also to report annually to the same committees, in a manner consistent with the protection of U.S. national security, on: (1) the portions of the documents and applications filed with the courts established by the Chief Justice of the United States to grant electronic surveillance orders that include significant construction or interpretation of FISA provisions, not including the facts of any particular matter, which may be redacted; and (2) the portions of the opinions and orders of such courts that include significant construction or interpretation of such provisions. Requires the first such reports to be filed within six months after enactment of this Act."
