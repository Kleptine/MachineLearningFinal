"9/16/2003--Passed Senate without amendment. RETURNED FOR REVISIONS (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Disapproves the broadcast media ownership rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and received by Congress on July 10, 2003. (That rule replaces the prohibition on common ownership of daily newspapers and broadcast outlets in the same market and the restrictions on common ownership of radio and television outlets in the same market with Cross Media Limits; revises the market definition and the way stations are counted for purposes of the local radio rule; revises the local television multiple ownership rule; modifies the national television ownership cap from a 35% national audience reach limit to a 45% reach limit, and retains the dual network rule.)"
