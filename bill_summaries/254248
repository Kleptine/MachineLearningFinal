"5/24/2012--Introduced. Reaffirms that the U.S. government and the governments of other responsible countries have a vital interest in working together to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability. Warns that time is limited to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability. Urges economic and diplomatic pressure on Iran until it implements: (1) suspension of uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities and is in compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions, (2) cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concerning Iran's nuclear activities, and (3) a permanent agreement that verifiably assures that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful. Supports: (1) the P5+1 process, (2) the universal rights and democratic aspirations of the people of Iran, and (3) U.S. policy to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability. Joins the President in ruling out any policy that would rely on containment as an option in response to the Iranian nuclear threat. States that nothing in this resolution shall be construed as an authorization for the use of force or a declaration of war."
