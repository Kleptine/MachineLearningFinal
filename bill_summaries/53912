Prohibits FERC from approving a rate or charge for the sale of electricity by EWGs: (1) where a State commission would use the purchase of such electricity as the basis for not permitting recovery of existing capital investment by the purchasing utility (stranded investment); or (2) where the wholesale purchaser is merely a broker interposed for purposes of making an indirect sale to an industrial or other retail customer (sham wholesale transaction, also known as \"cherry picking\"). Declares that an electric utility company may not enter into a contract to purchase electric energy at wholesale from an EWG if the EWG is an affiliate or associate company, unless every State commission having jurisdiction over the retail rates of such electric utility company specifically determines in advance of the contract that the transaction will benefit consumers, is in the public interest, and does not violate any State law (including, where applicable, least cost planning). Declares that any rate or charge for the wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce by an EWG shall not be considered just and reasonable if it allows the EWG to receive undue advantage resulting from the fact that the purchaser is an affiliate or associate company of the EWG. Prohibits reciprocal arrangements among companies that are not affiliates or associate companies of each other that are entered into to avoid these provisions. Amends the Federal Power Act to grant State commissions (in accordance with State law) the authority to allow or disallow the inclusion of the costs of electric energy purchased at wholesale or retail rates subject to their jurisdiction, except in certain instances involving allocation of power costs within registered utility holding company systems. Extends such authority within such systems in instances involving purchase of power from EWGs. Amends PURPA to require State commissions to analyze the effects and utility purchasers of the use of leveraged capital structures by wholesale sellers of power (including ERGs) and the adequacy of fuel supplies employed by such sellers. Requires State commissions to consider reflecting the results of such analysis in approving or disapproving wholesale electricity purchases. Grants each affected State commission continuing and periodic access to relevant EWG records, including those of an electric utility company that is an affiliate or associate of such EWG.
