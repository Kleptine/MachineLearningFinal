"12/22/1995--Passed House amended. Amends rule XLVII (regarding limitations on outside employment and earned income) of the Rules of the House of Representatives to prohibit a Member, officer, or employee of the House from receiving: (1) advance payments on copyright royalties; or (2) copyright royalties pursuant to a contract entered into on or after January 1, 1996, unless the contract is first approved by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct and such royalties are received from an established publisher pursuant to usual and customary contractual terms. Allows any literary agent, researcher, or other individual (other than a House employee or a relative of a Member, officer, or employee) working on behalf of a Member, officer, or employee with respect to a publication to receive an advance payment of a copyright royalty directly from a publisher and solely for the benefit of that literary agent, researcher, or other individual."
