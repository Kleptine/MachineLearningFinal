Sets an annual risk premium rate limitation of 25% for such properties. Prohibits the Director from providing flood insurance to prospective insureds at risk premium rates less than those otherwise estimated (federal subsidy) for new or lapsed policies, or to any prospective insured who refuses to accept any offer for FEMA mitigation assistance by the Administrator.
