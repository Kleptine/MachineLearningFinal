"4/14/1999--Passed House amended. Local Census Quality Check Act - Requires each decennial census to include an opportunity for postcensus local review, similar to that afforded as part of the 1990 decennial census, so that local governmental units may review household counts, jurisdictional boundaries, and such other data as the Secretary of Commerce considers appropriate for identifying discrepancies or other potential problems before the tabulation of total population by States is completed. Sets forth a timetable and guidelines for conducting such review, challenging census data, and correcting any identified miscounts."
