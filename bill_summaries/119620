"9/25/2002--Passed House without amendment. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the Congress should complete action in the 107th Congress on the Retirement Security Savings Act of 2002 and should present such legislation to the President for his signature prior to adjournment, so that workers can be assured that certain pension reforms under current law, which are permanently extended by such Act, will not be eliminated."
