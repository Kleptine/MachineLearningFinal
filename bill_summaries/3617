Includes as responsibilities of the Director of ARPA-E: (1) the research and development of advanced manufacturing process and technologies for the domestic manufacturing of novel energy technologies; and (2) with respect to achieving ARPA-E goals through energy technology projects by accelerating transformational technological advances in areas that industry is not likely to undertake because of technical and financial uncertainty, ensuring that applications for funding disclose the extent of current and prior efforts in pursuit of the technology area for which funding is being requested, adopting measures to ensure that program managers adhere to the objectives of accelerating such technological advances in such areas in making awards under this section, and providing a summary in the annual report of the instances and reasons for ARPA-E funding projects in technology areas already being undertaken by industry. Authorizes the Director to provide awards through grants and other transactions to carry out ARPA-E. Requires the Director to establish within ARPA-E a staff to enable ARPA-E to carry out its responsibilities in conjunction with the operations of DOE. Requires the Director to designate ARPA-E employees to serve as program directors (under current law, as program managers). Eliminates the requirement that energy technology projects to be supported under a program established within ARPA-E shall be selected with advice from certain advisory committees, as appropriate. Includes as responsibilities of program directors the identification of: (1) innovative cost-sharing arrangements for ARPA-E projects, including through use of the authority under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 for reducing or eliminating the 20% non-federal cost share requirement with respect to a research and development activity of an applied nature; and (2) mechanisms for commercial application of successful energy technology development projects, including through establishment of partnerships between awardees and commercial entities. Revises program manager terms. Revises the requirement for the compensation of the scientific, engineering, and professional personnel appointed by the Director. Modifies the restriction on the number of such personnel whom the Director has the authority to appoint. Extends the deadlines for submission of the strategic vision roadmaps to Congress. Instructs the Director to seek opportunities to partner with purchasing and procurement programs of federal agencies to demonstrate energy technologies resulting from activities funded through ARPA-E. Extends by two years the period under which the Secretary shall offer to contract with NAS for an evaluation of how well ARPA-E is achieving its goals and mission and how lessons learned from the operation of ARPA-E may apply to the operation of other DOE programs. Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2013 to the Director to carry out the purposes of ARPA-E. Increases the percentage of the amount allocated for use for technology transfer and outreach activities of ARPA-E.  \n    Title\n    X\n     - \n    Education\n    \n    Section\n    1002\n     - \n    \n    Repeals specified provisions of the America COMPETES Act relating to math and science and critical foreign language education.  \n    Section\n    1003\n     - \n    \n    Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2013 for the Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program to carry out grant programs for baccalaureate degrees and master's degrees in STEM or critical foreign languages.
