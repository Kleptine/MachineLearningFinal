"3/21/1996--Passed Senate amended. Deplores the missile tests and military exercises that the People's Republic of China (PRC) is conducting from March 8 through March 25, 1996, as potentially serious threats to the peace, security, and stability of Taiwan and not in the spirit of the three United States-China Joint Communiques. Urges the Government of the PRC to cease its bellicose actions and enter into meaningful dialogue with the Government of Taiwan at the highest levels with an eye toward decreasing tensions and resolving the issue of the future of Taiwan. Calls on the President, consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, to: (1) immediately consult with the Congress on an appropriate U.S. response to the tests and exercises should they pose an actual threat to the peace, security, and stability of Taiwan; and (2) reexamine the nature and quantity of defense articles and services that may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability in light of the heightened military threat. Calls for the Government of Taiwan to remain committed to the peaceful resolution of its future relations with the PRC by mutual decision."
