"2/10/1999--Passed House amended. Mandates Information Act of 1999 - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in preparing estimates of the direct costs of a Federal private sector mandate to estimate, when applicable, the impact of such mandate on consumers, workers, and small businesses, including any disproportionate impact in particular regions or industries. Revises provisions concerning legislation subject to a point of order to: (1) define the point of order for a determination by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office that it is not feasible to determine the economic impact of a Federal mandate; and (2) replace certain references to Federal intergovernmental mandates with references to Federal mandates with respect to legislation reported by the Appropriations Committees. Provides a point of order against consideration of legislation that would increase the direct costs of Federal private sector mandates (excluding direct costs attributable to revenue resulting from tax or tariff provisions of any such measure if it does not raise net tax and tariff revenues over the five-fiscal-year period beginning with the first fiscal year such measure affects such revenues) by an amount that causes the stated threshold of $100 million per fiscal year to be exceeded. Requires the Director, at the request of a Senator, to prepare an estimate of the direct costs of a Federal mandate (currently, Federal intergovernmental mandate) contained in such Senator's amendment. Revises the definition of \"Federal intergovernmental mandate\" to mean any provision in legislation, statute, or regulation that relates to a then-existing Federal program under which $500 million or more is provided annually to State, local, or tribal governments under entitlement authority, and that meets certain other criteria, if such legislation, statute, or regulation does not provide participating State, local, or tribal governments with new or expanded authority (currently, if such governments lacks authority) to amend financial or programmatic responsibilities to continue providing required services affected by the legislation, statute, or regulation."
