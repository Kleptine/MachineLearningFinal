Requires a court, in determining whether a circumstance was adequately taken into consideration, to consider only the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of the Commission, together with any amendments thereto by act of Congress. Amends the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to allow a sentencing court to impose a sentence below the authorized range only if the court finds that there is a mitigating circumstance of a kind or to a degree that: (1) has been affirmatively and specifically identified as a permissible ground of downward departure in the sentencing guidelines or policy statements, taking into account any amendments thereto by act of Congress; (2) has not been adequately taken into consideration by the Commission in formulating its guidelines; and (3) should result in a sentence different from that described.

Requires the Chief Judge of each district court to ensure that the report submitted to the Commission by the sentencing court within 30 days following entry of judgment in every criminal case includes: (1) the judgment and commitment order; (2) the statement of reasons for the sentence imposed (including the reason for any departure from the otherwise applicable guideline range); (3) any plea agreement; (4) the indictment or other charging document; and (5) the pre-sentence report. Directs the Commission: (1) upon request, to make available to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees the written reports and all underlying records accompanying those reports, as well as other records received from courts; and (2) to submit to Congress at least annually an analysis of these documents, any recommendations for legislation that the Commission concludes is warranted by that analysis, and an accounting of those districts that the Commission believes have not submitted the appropriate information and documents required. Considers a defendant to have engaged in a pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct if, on at least two separate occasions, such defendant engaged in such conduct with a minor.

Requires the Commission to review the grounds of downward departure authorized by the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary, and promulgate: (1) appropriate amendments to ensure that the incidence of downward departures are substantially reduced; (2) a policy statement authorizing a downward departure of not more than four levels if the government files a motion for such departure pursuant to an authorized early disposition program; and (3) any other necessary conforming amendments.  \n    Title\n    V\n     - \n    Obscenity and Pornography\n    \n    Subtitle\n    A\n     - \n    Child Obscenity and Pornography Prevention\n    \n    Section\n    502\n     - \n    \n    Allows as an affirmative defense to the charge of virtual child pornography only that: (1) the alleged pornography was produced using only actual persons all of whom were adults; or (2) the alleged pornography was not produced using any actual minors.
