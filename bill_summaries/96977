"9/28/1995--Passed House amended. Prohibits a U.S. district court or judge thereof from granting any application for an interlocutory or permanent injunction restraining the enforcement, operation, or execution of a State law adopted by referendum upon the ground of unconstitutionality unless such application is heard and determined by a three-judge court. Requires, in any such case, the additional judges to be designated as soon as practicable and the court to expedite the consideration of the application for an injunction. Requires any appeal of a determination on such application to be to the Supreme Court."
