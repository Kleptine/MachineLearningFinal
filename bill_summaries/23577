"9/24/1999--Introduced. Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) this Congress has taken strong steps to reform our Nation's educational system and allowed States, local schools and parents more flexibility and authority over their children's education; and (2) the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 will enable this Congress to continue its efforts to send decision making back to States, local schools, and families."
