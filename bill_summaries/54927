Requires the Government, for any offense punishable by death, to serve notice upon the defendant a reasonable time before trial or acceptance of a plea, of its intention to seek the death penalty and of the aggravating factors upon which it will rely. Specifies that the factors for which notice is provided shall include factors concerning the effect of the offense on the victim and the victim's family and shall be based on a victim impact statement that identifies the victim and the extent of the injury and loss suffered by the victim and the victim's family, describes the necessary course of treatment, and contains any other information related to the impact of the offense on the victim and the victim's family that the court may require. Requires a separate sentencing hearing before a jury, or the court upon motion by the defendant, when the defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to an offense punishable by death. Allows the defendant and the Government to present any information relevant to sentencing, without regard to the rules of evidence, but permits information to be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. Specifies mitigating factors which the defendant must establish by a preponderance of the information and aggravating factors which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Includes as threshold aggravating factors for homicide that the defendant: (1) intentionally killed the victim; (2) intentionally inflicted serious bodily injury which resulted in the death of the victim; (3) intentionally participated in an act, contemplating that the life of a person would be taken, and the victim died as a direct result of the act; (4) attempted to kill the President of the United States; or (5) intentionally engaged in an act constituting reckless disregard for human life, knowing that the act created a grave risk of death to someone other than the participants, and the victim died as a direct result of the act. Sets forth special aggravating factors with respect to the crimes of treason, espionage, homicide, and attempted murder of the President. Includes among the aggravating factors for homicide and attempted murder of the President the use or possession of a firearm under specified circumstances and a previous conviction of a violent felony involving a firearm. States that no person who was less than 18 years of age at the time of the offense may be sentenced to death. Prohibits the execution of mentally retarded persons or pregnant women. Directs the court, or the jury by unanimous vote, to impose the death penalty upon a finding that such sentence is justified based on consideration of both the aggravating and mitigating factors. Requires the court to instruct the jury: (1) not to consider the race, color, national origin, creed, or sex of the defendant or any victim in its consideration of the sentence; and (2) that it is not required to return a death sentence. Establishes procedures for appeal from a death sentence. Requires the Court of Appeals to review the record, address all substantive and procedural issues raised on appeal, and consider whether such sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor and whether the evidence supports the special finding of the existence of the required aggravating factor. Specifies that whenever such court finds that the sentence was imposed under such influence, the admissible evidence adduced does not support such special finding, or the proceedings involved any other legal error requiring reversal of the sentence that was properly preserved for and raised on appeal, the court shall remand the case for reconsideration or impose a sentence other than death (and, in any other case, remand for reconsideration.) Requires the court to provide a written explanation of its determination. Prohibits requiring any employee of any State department of corrections, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, or any provider of services under contract to participate in any execution if participation is contrary to his or her moral or religious convictions. Bars the imposition of a death sentence for a death-eligible offense committed in Indian country unless the Indian tribe having criminal jurisdiction over land and persons subject to such jurisdiction has elected to have this title apply in such cases.

Imposes time limits on filing for habeas corpus relief. Requires such time limits to be tolled under specified conditions. Requires the district court, upon the development of a complete evidentiary record, to rule on the merits of the claims properly before it. Makes the requirement for a certificate of probable cause inapplicable, with exceptions, where: (1) a second or successive petition is filed; and (2) certain requirements under a unitary review procedure (i.e., a State procedure that authorizes a person under sentence of death to raise, in the course of direct review of judgment, such claims as could be raised on collateral attack) are met. Sets forth time limits for determining petitions. Specifies that the adjudication of petitions or motions involving habeas corpus in capital cases shall be granted priority by the district court and court of appeals over all noncapital matters. Directs the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts to report annually to the Congress on court compliance with the time limits established under this subtitle.  \n    Title\n    XII\n     - \n    Punishment of Gun Criminals\n    Gun Criminals Punishment Act of 1991 - \n    Subtitle\n    A\n     - \n    Increased Penalties for Gun Offenses\n    Requires that any individual who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, discharges a firearm that kills another person: (1) if the killing is a first degree murder, be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or any term of years, fined, or both; and (2) if the killing is other than a first degree murder, be fined, imprisoned for life or any term of years, or both.

Expresses the intent of the Congress that: (1) provisions under this Act be used to supplement but not supplant the efforts of State and local prosecutors in prosecuting crimes of violence and drug trafficking crimes that could be prosecuted under State law; and (2) the Attorney General shall give due deference to the interest of State or local prosecutors in prosecuting violations of State law.  \n    Subtitle\n    B\n     - \n    Firearms and Related Amendments\n    Establishes penalties for possessing (current law covers only using and carrying) an explosive during the commission of a felony.

Authorizes the Attorney General to: (1) require that the 15-day advance notice requirement with respect to the importation and exportation of listed chemicals apply to all exports of specific listed chemicals to specified nations, regardless of the status of certain customers in such country as \"regular customers,\" if he finds that such action is necessary to support effective diversion control programs or is required by treaty or other international agreement to which the United States is a party; and (2) waive the 15-day advance notice requirement for exports of specific listed chemicals to specified countries, and for the importation of specific listed chemicals, if he determines that such advance notice is not required for effective chemical control, subject to specified requirements.

Amends list I to add benzaldehyde and nitroethane, and delete D-lysergic acid, N-ethylephedrine, and N-ethylpseudoephedrine. Eliminates \"regular supplier\" status and creates \"regular importer\" status.

Expresses the sense of the Congress that guidelines issued by the U.S. Sentencing Commission should recommend that the term of imprisonment for such a violation be not less than five (or in the case of a willful violation, not less than ten) years. Authorizes: (1) the court to order that all or a portion of the earnings from work performed by a defendant in prison be withheld for payment of such costs; and (2) the Attorney General to direct that assets forfeited in connection with a prosecution under this Act be shared with State agencies that participated in the seizure or cleanup of the contaminated site.
