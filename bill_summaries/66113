"3/30/2004--Passed House amended. (This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 23, 2004. The summary of that version is repeated here.) ROTC and Military Recruiter Equal Access to Campus Act of 2004 - Amends Federal armed forces provisions to direct the Secretary to annually request, from each institution of higher education that has students participating at that institution in a Senior ROTC program during that academic year, a certification that the institution will, during the next academic year: (1) permit the Secretary of each military department to maintain a unit of the Senior ROTC at that institution, should the department Secretary elect to maintain such a unit; and (2) if the department Secretary elects not to maintain such a unit, permit a student of that institution to enroll in a Senior ROTC unit at another institution. Denies the provision of funds made available for certain Federal departments and agencies to institutions of higher education unless military recruiters are provided access to campuses at such institutions that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses and students that is provided to any other employer. Adds the Department of Homeland Security, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and the Central Intelligence Agency to the list of Federal departments and agencies whose funds will be denied to postsecondary schools that prevent ROTC access or military recruiting. Codifies under Federal armed forces law a provision of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2000 which excludes from such funding prohibition any amounts provided solely for student financial assistance, related administrative costs, or costs associated with attendance."
