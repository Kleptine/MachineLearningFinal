Requires the Secretary of the Interior to take lands identified as alternative lands in the Settlement of Land Claim (the agreement between the Bay Mills Indian Community and the Governor of Michigan executed on August 23, 2002, including the document titled Addendum to Settlement of Land Claim, executed on November 13, 2007) into trust for the benefit of the Community within 30 days after the Secretary has: (1) received a title insurance policy for the alternative lands that shows that such lands are not subject to mortgages, liens, deeds of trust, options to purchase, or other security interests; and (2) confirmed that the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 has been complied with regarding the trust acquisition of the property. Provides for the alternative lands to become part of the Community's reservation immediately upon attaining trust status.

Extinguishes, concurrent with the Secretary taking the alternative lands into trust, all claims by the Community: (1) to the Charlotte Beach lands; or (2) against the United States, the State of Michigan, or any other person or entity based on or relating to claims to such lands, whether based on aboriginal or recognized title. Approves and ratifies the Settlement of Land Claim, which shall be enforceable by the Community or the Governorn according to its terms. Vests exclusive jurisdiction over any enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan."
