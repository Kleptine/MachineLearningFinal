"2/4/1997--Introduced. Expresses the sense of the Senate that studies are needed to further determine the benefits of screening women between the ages of 40 and 49 through mammography and other emerging technologies and that the Senate urges the Advisory Panel for the National Cancer Institute to consider reissuing a specified guideline rescinded in 1993 and, until there is more definitive data, direct the public to consider guidelines issued by other organizations."
