Requires the use of sealed bids or competitive proposals. \n    Section\n    101\n     - \n    \n    Revises requirements for the use of other than competitive procedures to allow them only when use of competitive procedures is not feasible or appropriate, for which standards shall be set forth in the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR).
