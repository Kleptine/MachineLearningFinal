"12/16/2005--Passed House without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Declares that: (1) the House of Representatives is committed to achieving victory in Iraq; (2) the presence of the U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq will only be required until Iraqi forces can stand up on their own; and (3) an artificial timetable for terminating the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq is inconsistent with achieving victory. Acknowledges the Iraqi December 15, 2005, election as a crucial victory for its new democracy. Encourages Americans to express solidarity with the Iraq people and their goal of a democratic society. Honors the sacrifices made by the U.S. Armed Forces, their families, and members of the Iraq and Coalition forces. Expresses confidence that the U.S. Armed Forces, along with Iraqi and Coalition forces, will achieve victory in Iraq."
