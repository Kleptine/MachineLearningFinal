"10/31/1989--Introduced. Condemns Daniel Ortega's announced intention to abrogate the ceasefire in Nicaragua as unjustified and a threat to peace. Urges the Sandinistas to renew their commitment to continuing the ceasefire. Insists that Ortega and the Sandinistas reaffirm their pledge to hold elections on February 25, 1990, and begin to carry out in good faith their commitment to a free and fair electoral process leading up to those elections. Deplores any effort by the Sandinista regime to terminate, postpone, or curtail progress in fulfilling such commitment or to impose emergency laws under the pretext of a breakdown of the ceasefire. Urges the extension of the grace period during which Nicaraguans are permitted to register to vote for at least 60 days. Reaffirms the Congress's intention to abide by the provisions of the Bipartisan Accord on Nicaragua and Public Law 101-14, to include continuing to provide humanitarian assistance to the contras until February 28, 1990. Reminds Ortega, the Sandinistas, and the other leaders of the hemisphere that U.S. policy articulated therein is contingent upon the Sandinistas fulfilling their commitments as part of the Central American peace process."
