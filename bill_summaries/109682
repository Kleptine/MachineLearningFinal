"7/23/1997--Introduced. Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the failure of the Government of Canada to stop Canadian fishing vessels from blockading and to allow the passage of a certain U.S. passenger vessel through Canadian waters should be condemned; (2) the President should take steps to protect U.S. interests and should not tolerate threats to those interests from the action or inaction of a foreign government or its citizens; (3) the President should provide assistance to States and U.S. citizens seeking damages in Canada that have resulted from such illegal or harassing actions; and (4) the President should use all appropriate means, including sanctions like selected import restrictions, to compel the Government of Canada to prevent any such further actions against the United States, its citizens, or interests."
