"4/12/2000--Passed House amended. Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to reauthorize grants to States for carrying out methods and procedures to control pollution sources from, and restore quality of, lakes (clean lakes program). Adds Otsego and Oneida Lakes, New York, Raystown Lake, Pennsylvania, and Swan Lake, Itasca County, Minnesota, to the list of lakes given priority for demonstration projects under a lake water quality demonstration program. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, notwithstanding a provision of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 that eliminates certain Federal reporting requirements, to report to specified congressional committees on work undertaken under the program. Increases the maximum amount of appropriations authorized for grants to States for carrying out methods to mitigate effects of high acidity in lakes. Expresses the sense of Congress that entities receiving assistance under this Act should, in expending such assistance, purchase only American-made equipment and products. Requires such entities to report any expenditures on foreign-made items to Congress."
