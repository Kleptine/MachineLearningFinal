"3/18/1998--Introduced. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States should: (1) condemn the Serbian Government controlled by Slobodan Milosevic for gross human rights violations against its citizens; (2) condemn any terrorist actions by any group or individual in Kosovo; (3) freeze funds of the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia if the Serbian Government fails to comply by March 25, 1998, with the terms set forth by the Contact Group (the six-nation group established to monitor the situation in the former Yugoslavia); (4) demand that the Serbian Government and the ethnic Albanian leadership and representatives of all ethnic and religious groups in Kosovo immediately begin unconditional talks to achieve a peaceful resolution to the Kosovo conflict and to provide for the exercise of the legitimate civil and political rights of all persons in Kosovo; and (5) demand that international human rights monitors be allowed to return immediately to Kosovo to be able to report on all human rights violations. Calls for the international community to respond affirmatively to the call of the Contact Group for the imposition of broad-based sanctions against the Serbian Government if it fails to prevent additional atrocities by the police and paramilitary units under its control or does not otherwise comply immediately with the terms set forth by that Group."
